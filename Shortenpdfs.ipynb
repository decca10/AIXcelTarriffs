The Baseline Load for any fifteen (15) minute interval during an event will be calculated as the average of the measured Demand during the same interval of the C ustomer’s five (5) highest \\nenergy consumption days within the last ten (10) non- Holiday, non- weekend, \\nnon-event days.  Baseline Load calculations will be modified by a Baseline Load \\nAdjustment to correct for substantive differences between baseline calculations and conditions on the day of an event. \\n \\nBaseline Load Adjustment  \\nAn event day correction will be made to a participant’s Baseline Load \\nfor each fifteen (15) m inute interval during the event to reflect weather or other \\nsubstantive differences between the C ustomer’s load on the event day and the \\nbaseline calculation.  The Baseline Load Adjustment will be the average fifteen (15) minute Kilowatt ( kW) difference between the baseline calculation and the \\nCustomer’s actual load during the two (2) hours prior to Event Notification.  \\nThis calculated difference will be added to the C ustomer’s Baseline Load for \\neach fifteen (15) minute interval within the Curtailment Event window.  The \\nevent day correction may either raise or lower the C ustomer’s baseline load. \\n \\nCurtailment Event \\nThe Company may initiate a curtailment event either (1) when there is a \\ncapacity, contingency and/or economic constraint upon the electrical syste m, or \\n(2) at the Company’s discretion, for up to two (2) test events each calendar Y ear.  \\nEvents may be called between the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.  Events will be no less than one (1) hour in duration and no more than four (4) hours in duration w ithin this time period.  Customers will be subject to no more than one \\n(1) event in any twenty -four (24) hour period.  No more than fifteen (15) events \\ncan be called for any one (1) C ustomer during a given year (sixty (60) total event \\nhours).  Should a capacity or contingency situation arise outside of the prescribed hours of 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., program participants may be notified and asked to curtail load on a “best effort” basis. The C ustomer will be \\nunder no obligation to reduce load, but those abl e to participate will be \\ncompensated for energy reductions at the Performance Incentive level.  \\n \\nContinued on Sheet No. 118B ) \\n   1735         February 14, 2017 \\n  R17- 0028 February 17, 2017 \\n  \\n \\nN \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs   COLO.

Customers are responsible for insuring contact information \\nis kept current and notifying the Program Manager if any changes are necessary.  \\n \\nLoad Reduction \\nLoad Reduction is a calculation of the effective amount of load, in \\nKilowat t (kW), that a Customer was able to curtail during a curtailment event.  \\nThe load reduction is calculated by subtracting the C ustomer’s actual usage, in \\nKilowatt- Hour ( kWh) , during an event from the C ustomer’s baseline usage \\nduring the same time period, and dividing by the number of hours within the Curtailment Event.  \\n \\nLoad Reduction Obligation \\nA Customer’s Load Reduction Obligation is the load a Customer under \\nthis schedule agrees to curtail during a Curtailment Event. Each participating Customer will be r esponsible for reducing their facilities load during an event \\nby an amount equal to or greater than that designated within their contract.  Customers will designate their load reduction obligations, in terms of Kilowatt \\n(kW), by calendar M onth.  The Kilowa tt (kW) commitment can vary each \\nMonth and may be a zero Kilowatt ( kW) commitment, however during the \\nsummer Months of June through September the Customers commitment \\ncannot be less than twenty -five Kilowatts (25 kW).  The load reduction \\nobligation must be  achievable by a C ustomer during non- Holiday weekdays \\nbetween the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. \\nDuring the portion of a Curtailment Event which falls between the \\nhours of 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., a C ustomer’s Load Reduction must meet or \\nexceed their nom inated Load Reduction Obligation to be eligible to receive \\nthe Performance Incentive.  \\n  \\n(Continued on Sheet No. 118C ) \\n   1735                              February 14, 2017 \\n  R17- 0028           February 17, 2017 \\n  \\n \\nN \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs   COLO.

The Company shall retain complete discretion as to which Customers or potential Customers shall be offered flexible pricing.  \\n \\nREQUIREMENTS FOR FLEXIBLE PRICING \\n In order for flexible pricing to be considered for a specific electric service Customer or potential \\nelectric service Customer, the following facts must first be demonstrated by the Company: \\n1. The price of any such service is not below the variable cost of providing that service.  The  \\nvariable cost of the Company will be based on the average of production costs of the Company and purchased energy costs for Company load for the most recent twelve (12) \\nMonths ending December 31, expressed in dollars per net Megawatt -Hour.  The variable \\ncost will be the quotient of the sum of purchased energy costs, fuel, fuel handling and the \\npercentage of production operation and maintenance costs determined to be variable in the Company’s most recent general rate proceeding divided by the sum of net generation of the Company’s thermal units and energy purchased for Company load.  If the discounted price \\nis below the applicable tariff energy rate, the Company will maintain separate accounting records for those sales and will remove these sales and associated costs from the Electric Commodity  Adjustment calculation.  \\n2. The Customer, or potential Customer , has expressed its intention to decline or discontinue, \\nor partially discontinue service, to provide its own service, or to pursue the purchase of alternat e services from another provider.  \\n3. The approval of the flexibly priced rate will not adversely affect the remaining Customers of the Company.  Accounting records will be maintained and available for the inspection of the Staff of the Commission and the Office of Consumer Counsel, indicating the disposition of all costs associated with each flexibly priced contract and the conformance of this policy to the requirements of §40-3- 104.3(2)(a)  C.R.S. \\n4. The approval of the flexibly priced rate is in the publi c interest.  \\n              \\n(Continued on Sheet No. 145A)  \\n   1731         December 8, 2016 \\n   C16- 1075        January 1, 2017 \\n \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs    COLO.

The Company may require any applicant to sign an Application Contract before \\nservice is supplied.  However, the use of electric service constitutes an agreement under which the user receives electric service and agrees to pay the Company therefore in accordance with the applicable rate \\nschedules, Rules and R egulations.  Each person of full legal age who resides at the premises to which \\nservice is delivered shall be deemed to receive benefit of service supplied and shall be liable to the Company for  payment, subject to conditions hereinafter stated, whether or not service is listed in his/her \\nname.  The primary obligor for payment is the applicant or user in whose name service with the Company \\nis listed (“ Customer of record”).  The Company is obligat ed to pursue reasonable and timely efforts to \\neffect payment by or collections from the C ustomer of record.  In the event such efforts are unavailing, and \\nit is necessary for the Company to effect payment by or collection from a user who is not the Custome r of \\nrecord by transfer of an account or otherwise, the Company shall give prior written notice to said user that he/she may factually dispute the applicability of the benefit of service rule stated in this paragraph to his/her specific situation by making  written complaint to the Commission.  The benefits and obligations of \\nthe agreement for service may not be assigned without written consent of the Company.  A separate agreement , if necessary,  will be made for each class of service at each separate locati on. \\nWhere rental properties are concerned, the Company will not charge landlords or property \\nowners for electric service during a period of vacancy, unless the landlord or property owner has become the Company’s C ustomer of record as described immediately below.  During a period of \\nvacancy in rental properties, the landlord or property owner may contact the Company verbally or in writing to have electric service transferred to his/her name.  Upon application by the landlord or property owner to transfer ser vice into his/her name, the landlord or property owner becomes the \\nCustomer of record and service will be provided in the name of the landlord or property owner.  The \\nCompany reserves the option to discontinue service in accordance with the Discontinuance of Service \\nBy Company section of these Rules and Regulations in the event the landlord or property owner does not elect to transfer service during a period of vacancy.  In the event that the Company has on file a signed Billing of Vacant Rental Property Ag reement for the landlord or property owner at the time of \\nthe landlord’s or property owner’s request to transfer service from the prior C ustomer of record to the \\nlandlord or property owner, the Company will not charge for the transfer of service fee as shown on the \\nSchedule of Charges for Rendering Service.                    1731         December 8, 2016 \\n   C16- 1075        January 1, 2017 \\n \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs    COLO.

The first option is to allow the Company to estimate the Customer ’s consumption based upon the Customer ’s historic billing data.  The second option is for \\nthe Customer  to read their meter on the day of termination and send or call in that information to the \\nCompany.  Third option is the Customer  can request to have the Company read the meter and pay a \\nnon-regularly scheduled final meter reading charge under the Company’s Schedule of Charges for \\nRendering Service.

The bill will be considered as received by the Customer  when mailed to, or left at, the \\nlocation where service is used or at som e other location that has been mutually agreed upon.  Final bills, \\nweekly bills, special bills, and bills for connection and reconnection are due on presentation.  If the Customer  fails to receive a bill, the Company, upon request, will issue a duplicate.  However, failure to \\nreceive a bill in no way exempts the Customer  from payment for service rendered.  \\nWhen Company for any reason submits a bill to a Customer  for utility service which contains an \\nestimated reading or a no charge, Company will include on s uch bill a notice informing Customer that the \\nbill does contain an estimate or no charge.  Also included on such bill will be a statement requesting Customer  to call Company so an accurate meter reading may be obtained.  In all bills for additional \\ncharges  resulting from a period of estimated or skipped billings, Company will include a written notice of \\nCustomer \\'s right to pay such additional charges in installments, where such charges were not the result of \\nmeter inaccessibility and Customer \\'s refusal to r ead his or her own meter. \\nIf a Customer  gives notice at the Company\\'s office prior to the time that payment is due that the \\ncorrectness of the bill is disputed, stating reasons therefore, the Company will investigate the complaint.  However, such notice di sputing correctness of a bill shall not be sufficient reason for withholding \\npayment.  If the bill is found to be incorrect, the Company will refund the amount of overpayment or credit  \\nthe amount of overpayment to the next bill rendered.  \\n                   1731         December 8, 2016 \\n   C16- 1075        January 1, 2017 \\n \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs    COLO.

Customers served under rate \\nSchedules SST, PST and TST as well as seasonal Commercial or Industrial Customer s are not eligible fo r \\nservice on an Averaged Monthly Payment Plan.  A seasonal Customer  shall be a Customer  whose in-\\nseason billing demands for a minimum of six  (6) consecutive billing Months equal or exceed seventy -five \\npercent (75%) of the highest measured demand occurring during said period and whose off -season \\nmeasured demand during the prior off -season is less than thirty percent (30%) of the maximum in -season \\nmeasured demand for a minimum of three consecutive B illing Months.  \\n Residential, and Small Commercial Customers e lecting the Averaged Monthly Payment Plan shall \\npay a Monthly amount equal to the estimated total annual bill divided by twelve (12).  The estimated total annual bill is calculated based on a Customer’s most recent twelve (12) Months’ consumption and the then current rates of the Company.  If the Customer’s consumption information is available for less than \\ntwelve (12) Months, the available consumption information will be annualized to a common denominator of 365 days.  Unless a review on the subsequent fourth (4th), seventh (7th) or tenth (10th) Month following the initial averaged Monthly payment Month shows an annual payment surplus or deficiency \\nthat exceeds an  annual variance threshold, the average Monthly payment shall be paid by the Customer  for \\neleven (11) Months.  The twelfth Month\\'s payment shall be a settlement amount equal to the difference between the total of the prior eleven (11) Months\\' payments and the actual billings for the twelve (12) Month period. \\n This annual variance threshold is subjec t to change by the Company and is a fixed dollar amount \\napplicable to each residential or commercial Customer  for the remaining Months of the Averaged Monthly \\nPayment Plan Year .  Adjustments to the averaged Monthly payment amount will only be made to the \\nremaining Months, either up or down, if the annual payment deficiency or surplus exceeds the annual \\nvariance threshold.   \\n           1818         February 18, 2020 \\n   C20- 0096        February 25, 2020 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nD \\n \\n \\n \\nD \\n \\n \\n \\nD \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs    COLO.

Service to buildings appurtenant to the residence including garages, barns, and other minor buildings for use of the Customer  for Residential Service may also be \\nserved  through the residential meter.  \\n \\nMULTI -FAMILY DWELLINGS  \\n Service may be supplied under Residential Service rates, to duplex houses, multi -family dwellings, \\nrooming houses, apartment houses, mobile homes, or to more than one (1) residence on an integral par cel \\nof land and under one (1) ownership when requested by C ustomer or where, in opinion of Company, \\nservice cannot otherwise be supplied without excessive investment in meters and lines, as applicable. Service must be delivered to and paid for by one (1) Customer.  \\n In determining the number of living units for multi -family dwellings, each family dwelling place or \\nindividual housekeeping unit will be counted as a separate living unit.  In private residences or rooming houses where three (3) or more rooms are  used as tenant sleeping rooms only and not as housekeeping \\nunits with kitchen facilities, each three (3) rooms so used will be taken as a separate living unit, to the \\nnearest unit.  Where mobile home living units are served through C ustomer\\'s Residential Service meter, \\neach mobile home unit will be considered a separate living unit in the application of the rate.  However, temporary connection of a single mobile home will not be considered as establishment of an additional living unit.  The number of living units determined as aforesaid will prevail for a minimum period of four  \\n(4) Months.  Said number will not be changed for vacancies unless such vacancies are to be permanent.  \\nCustomer is responsible for notifying the Company of reductions and Company wil l bill the C ustomer on \\nthe basis of its records until notice of change is received.              \\n         1731         December 8, 2016 \\n   C16- 1075        January 1, 2017 \\n \\n  \\nADVICE LETTER  \\nNUMBER \\nDECISION / \\nPROCEEDING  \\nNUMBER ISSUE \\nDATE \\nEFFECTIVE DATE REG IONAL VICE PRESIDENT,  \\nRates & Regulatory Affairs    COLO.
