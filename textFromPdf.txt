be subject to no more than one Critical Peak Pricing Period per day.  The number of 
Critical Peak Pricing Periods impacting each Customer shall be a maximum of fifteen 
(15) Critical Peak Periods during a calendar Year. 
 
The Company may elect to call a Critical Peak Pricing Period based on the 
day-ahead  load  forecast,  generator  availability,  and  forecasted  renewable  resource 
generation.  In the event that the Company s day-ahead forecast indicates that system 
peaking  conditions  may  occur,  or  the  forecasted  total  available  generation  to  load 
ratio falls below one hundred and twenty percent (120%), the Company may elect to 
call a Critical Peak Pricing Period for the next day. 
The Company may also elect to call a Critical Peak Pricing Period based on 
forecasted energy and fuel costs for the coming day if that interruption is expected to 
lower its overall system costs compared to what the overall system cost would be in 
the absence of the interruption.   
The Company will also have the authority to call Critical Peak Pricing Periods 
for separate cohorts of Customers, meaning that not all Customers will have the same 
 
Critical Peak Pricing Periods.

Annual Allowed Grace Energy Hours for Standby Service use: 
 
Hours of Contract Standby Capacity, Standby Hours: 1,051 
Customer  will  be  allowed  each  Year  beginning  January  1st  or  on  a  date 
mutually  agreed  upon  by  the  Company  and  Customer,  an  Annual  Grace  Energy 
amount  equal  to  the  Standby  Hours  times  the  Contract  Standby  Capacity  without 
incurring a Monthly Usage Demand Charge. In the event that Distribution Contract 
Standby Capacity is different than the Generation and Transmission Contract Standby 
Capacity due to Customer having more than one generator serving a single load as 
provided herein, the Generation and Transmission Contract Capacity shall be used to 
calculate  the  Annual  Grace  Energy.    Energy  consumption  due  to  Customer  use  of 
Standby Service during a Company Non-Dispatch Period shall not count against the 
amount of Annual Grace Energy.  A Company Non-Dispatch Period is defined as the 
full  or  partial  generation  outage  time  of  a  Customer  who  is  subject  to  a  Power 
Purchase Agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company or its system 
operator  has  dispatch  authority  over  the  Customer s  facilities  have  not  been 
dispatched by the Company or its system operator. 
 
After  the  Annual  Grace  Energy  has  been  exhausted  and  Customer  uses 
Standby Service, the Customer shall pay the Monthly Usage Demand Charge.  In a 
Billing  Month,  when  Customer  uses  Standby  Service,  the  Schedule  SG  Billing 
Demand and the Monthly Usage billing demand will be determined separately.  The 
Schedule  SG  Billing  Demand  will  be  the  maximum  fifteen  (15)  minute  integrated 
Kilowatt Demand determined after separating Standby Service usage from the total 
metered Demands.  The date and time within each Billing Month of the Schedule SG 
Measured  Demand  may  or  may  not  be  at  the  same  date  and  time  as  the  Standby 
Monthly Usage Measured Demand.  Standby Monthly Usage Billing Demand will be

described.

PROVISION  FOR  CUSTOMERS  WITH  MULTIPLE  GENERATORS  AND 
SERVICES AT A SINGLE FACILITY 
In  the  event  that  the  Customer  has  installed  more  than  one  generator  and 
receives Standby Service from the Company separately for each generator s facility 
load  where  such  load  is  at  a  single  facility  for  a  single  business  on  contiguous 
property,  the  metered  load  supplied  by  the  Company  as  well  as  the  metered  load 
generated by the Customer may be aggregated for purposes of determining Contract 
Standby Capacity. 
 
CONTRACT PERIOD 
All contracts under this schedule shall be for a minimum period of one Year 
and  one  (1)  Year  periods  thereafter  until  terminated,  where  service  is  no  longer 
required, on thirty (30) days  notice.  Greater minimum periods may be required by 
contract in situations involving large or unusual loads. 
 
METER INSTALLATION 
The  Company  shall  install,  own,  operate,  and  maintain,  the  metering  to 
measure  the  electric  power  and  energy  supplied  to  Customer  to  allow  for  proper 
billing of the separate Schedule SG Service and Standby Service demands and grace 
period identified above.  In particular, the Company will install a meter that measures 
the  flow  of  power  and  energy  from  the  Customer s  own  generating  facility 
(Production  Metering).    The  Customer  shall  pay  the  Monthly  Production  Meter 
Charge under this schedule.  
As  a  result  of  the  electrical  or  physical  configuration  of  the  Customer s 
generation  facility,  the  Company  may  determine  that  it  is  more  practical  or 
economical to use Production Metering installed and owned by the Customer, rather 
than  installing  Company-owned  metering  equipment.    If  the  Company,  at  its  sole 
discretion,  makes  such  a  determination,  then  the  Customer-owned  Production 
Metering may be used for billing purposes, so long as such metering equipment meets 
the Company s standards for quality and accuracy.

requirements  for  the  Production  Meter(s),  the  Company  determines,  at  its  sole 
discretion, that it is impracticable, uneconomical or unnecessary to install metering on 
the  Customer s  generator(s),  the  Company  shall  determine  the  billing  for  the 
provision of the Standby Service tariff on an un-metered and calculated basis.  This 
determination can only be made if the only electrical load located at the Customer s 
site  is  station  power  equipment  as  defined  by  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory 
Commission. 
Regardless  of  the  Company s  ultimate  determination  of  the  requirement  (or 
lack thereof) for installation of Production Metering, a meter will always be required 
at  the  Point  of  Delivery  between  the  Company  and  Customer  and  such  meter  will 
measure both delivered and received capacity and energy.

AVAILABILITY 
 
Available to Customers with a minimum average Monthly Load Factor of thirty 
percent (30%) as measured for the previous twelve (12) consecutive Months.  Once a 
Customer  requesting  service  under  this  tariff  demonstrates  a  Load  Factor  of  at  least 
thirty  percent  (30%)  and  is  deemed  eligible  for  service  under  the  tariff,  then  the 
Customer can remain on the schedule even if the Customer s Load Factor subsequently 
falls  below  thirty  percent  (30%).    Eligibility  qualifications  for  new  construction  for 
SPVTOU where twelve (12) Months of historical usage is unavailable will be reviewed 
based on the submitted Electric Load forecast as part of the solar application. 
Notwithstanding the above, available to those six (6) irrigation Customer loads 
where a PV System was installed prior to January 1, 2010.  The annual amount of new 
capacity eligible to take service under Section A is capped at the projected amount of 
on-site  PV  system  capacity  for  medium  size  facilities  (10  kW     500  kW)  in  the 
Company s Solar*Rewards  program.  
The annual incremental load eligible for service under Section B will be capped 
at the annual PV capacity limit approved for the Solar*Rewards  Medium program for 
the  same  Year.    If  in  a  calendar  Year  the  Company  has  new  participants  in  the 
SPVTOU tariff totaling thirty-six (36) Megawatts in aggregate noncoincident demand, 
the Company will temporarily suspend the SPVTOU tariff to new entrants and convene 
a meeting of the Existing Voluntary Renewable Stakeholder Group to discuss the issue 
and seek a resolution.

DEFINITIONS 
 
Customer s Total Load 
The Customer s Total Load shall be determined by meter measurement 
of the total capacity requirements of the Customer, regardless of whether such 
capacity  is  supplied  by  the  Company,  the  Customer s  own  generation 
equipment, or a combination of both. 
Contract Standby Capacity 
The  level  of  Contract  Standby  Capacity  in  Kilowatts  the  Company 
reserves in its distribution system and its generation and transmission systems 
for the Customer as set forth in the Electric Standby Service Agreement.  The 
Contract Standby Capacity shall be the lesser of the Customer s Total Load, the 
Customer s  generation  capacity  or  the  maximum  capacity  available  from  the 
 
Company s  system  and  is  the  maximum  amount  of  Standby  Service  the 
Company is obligated to supply.  This quantity may be different between the 
Summer and Winter Seasons.

DETERMINATION OF MONTHLY USAGE DEMAND 
 
For  billing  purposes,  the  Customer s  Billing  Demand  for  the  Monthly  Usage 
Demand  Charge  will  be  determined  separately  from  and  will  have  no  effect  on  the 
Billing  Demand  determined  under  Schedule  PG  that  this  tariff  complements.    The 
Monthly Usage Billing Demand shall be the maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated 
Demand portion of the load that is normally supplied by the Customer s generation and 
covered by the Contract Standby Capacity that is actually supplied by the Company.  
After the Annual Grace Energy has been exhausted, all such usage shall be billed as 
Monthly Usage Billing Demand. 
 
ANNUAL GRACE ENERGY  
 
 
 
 
 
Customer  will  be  allowed  each  Year  beginning  January  1st  or  on  a  date 
mutually agreed upon by the Company and Customer, an Annual Grace Energy amount 
equal to the Standby Hours times the Contract Standby Capacity without incurring a 
Monthly  Usage  Demand  Charge.  In  the  event  that  Distribution  Contract  Standby 
Capacity is different than the Generation and Transmission Contract Standby Capacity 
due  to  Customer  having  more  than  one  generator  serving  a  single  load  as  provided 
herein, the Generation and Transmission Contract Capacity shall be used to calculate 
the  Annual  Grace  Energy.    Energy  consumption,  due  to  Customer  use  of  Standby 
Service during a Company Non-Dispatch Period, shall not count against the amount of 
Annual  Grace  Energy.    A  Company  Non-Dispatch  Period  is  defined  as  the  full  or 
partial  generation  outage  time  of  a  Customer  who  is  subject  to  a  Power  Purchase 
Agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company or its system operator 
has dispatch authority over the Customer s facilities and the Customer s facilities have 
not been dispatched by the Company or its system operator.   
 
After the Annual Grace Energy has been exhausted and Customer uses Standby 
Service,  the  Customer  shall  pay  the  Monthly  Usage  Demand  Charge.    In  a  Billing 
Month, when Customer uses Standby Service, the Schedule PG Billing Demand and 
the Monthly Usage Billing Demand will be determined separately.  The Schedule PG 
Billing Demand will be the maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated Kilowatt Demand 
determined  after  separating  Standby  Service  usage  from  the  total  metered  Demands.  
 
The date and time within each Billing Month of the Schedule PG Measured  Demand 
may or may not be at the same date and time as the Standby Monthly Usage Measured 
Demand.    Standby  Monthly  Usage  Billing  Demand  will  be  in  addition  to  the  Billed 
Demand charges under the Schedule PG as previously described.

PROVISION  FOR  CUSTOMERS  WITH  MULTIPLE  GENERATORS  AND 
SERVICES AT A SINGLE FACILITY 
In  the  event  that  the  Customer  has  installed  more  than  one  generator  and 
receives Standby Service from the Company separately for each generator s facility 
load  where  such  load  is  at  a  single  facility  for  a  single  business  on  contiguous 
property,  the  metered  load  supplied  by  the  Company  as  well  as  the  metered  load 
generated by the Customer may be aggregated for purposes of determining Contract 
Standby Capacity. 
 
CONTRACT PERIOD 
All contracts under this schedule shall be for a minimum period of one Year 
and one-Year periods thereafter until terminated, where service is no longer required, 
on thirty (30) days  notice.  Greater minimum periods may be required by contract in 
situations involving large or unusual loads. 
 
METER INSTALLATION 
The  Company  shall  install,  own,  operate,  and  maintain,  the  metering  to 
measure  the  electric  power  and  energy  supplied  to  Customer  to  allow  for  proper 
billing of the separate Schedule PG Service and Standby Service demands and grace 
period identified above.  In particular, the Company will install a meter that measures 
the  flow  of  power  and  energy  from  the  Customer s  own  generating  facility 
(Production  Metering).    The  Customer  shall  pay  the  Monthly  Production  Meter 
Charge under this schedule. 
As  a  result  of  the  electrical  or  physical  configuration  of  the  Customer s 
generation  facility,  the  Company  may  determine  that  it  is  more  practical  or 
economical to use Production Metering installed and owned by the Customer, rather 
than  installing  Company-owned  metering  equipment.    If  the  Company,  at  its  sole 
discretion,  makes  such  a  determination,  then  the  Customer-owned  Production 
Metering may be used for billing purposes, so long as such metering equipment meets 
the Company s standards for quality and accuracy. 
If,  through  the  course  of  the  Company s  evaluation  of  the  metering 
requirements  for  the  Production  Meter(s),  the  Company  determines,  at  its  sole 
discretion, that it is impracticable, uneconomical or unnecessary to install metering on 
the  Customer s  generator(s),  the  Company  shall  determine  the  billing  for  the 
provision of the Standby Service tariff on an un-metered and calculated basis.  This 
 
determination can only be made if the only electrical load located at the Customer s 
site  is  station  power  equipment  as  defined  by  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory 
Commission.

CRITICAL PEAK PRICING PERIOD  
 
A Critical Peak Pricing Period shall be a consecutive four hour (4 hr.) window 
between and within the hours of noon and 8:00 p.m. Mountain Time.  Customers will 
be subject to no more than one Critical Peak Pricing Period per day.  The number of 
Critical Peak Pricing Periods impacting each Customer shall be a maximum of fifteen 
(15) Critical Peak Pricing Periods during a calendar Year. 
 
The Company may elect to call a Critical Peak Pricing Period based on the 
day-ahead  load  forecast,  generator  availability,  and  forecasted  renewable  resource 
generation.  In the event that the Company s day-ahead forecast indicates that system 
peaking  conditions  may  occur,  or  the  forecasted  total  available  generation  to  load 
ratio  falls below  one hundred and twenty percent (120%), the Company may elect to 
call a Critical Peak Pricing Period for the next day. 
The Company may also elect to call a Critical Peak Pricing Period based on 
forecasted energy and fuel costs for the coming day if that interruption is expected to 
lower its overall system costs compared to what the overall system cost would be in 
the absence of the interruption.   
The Company will also have the authority to call Critical Peak Pricing Periods 
for separate cohorts of Customers, meaning that not all Customers will have the same 
Critical Peak Pricing Periods.  
 
CRITICAL PEAK PRICING PERIOD NOTICE 
 
The  Company  shall  provide  Customers  notice  of  a  Critical  Peak  Pricing 
Period not less than twenty-two hours (22 hrs) before a Critical Peak Pricing Period is 
established.    Customers  will  be  notified  of  the  Critical  Peak  Pricing  Period  for the 
following day either by e-mail, by leaving a voice message at the Customer s primary 
phone number or through other methods agreed to by the Company and the Customer.  
If  the  primary  number  is  unavailable,  a  voice  message  will  be  left  at  a  secondary 
phone number provided by the Customer.  Successful notification will be determined 
either  by  receipt  of  a  voice  mail  at  the  primary  or  secondary  phone  number  or  by 
delivery receipt of an electronic mail message.  The Company may elect to remove 
the Customer from service hereunder if the Company cannot notify the Customer as

The Generation and Transmission Standby Capacity Reservation Fee Payment 
shall be determined by multiplying the Contract Standby Capacity times the Generation

DETERMINATION OF MONTHLY USAGE DEMAND 
 
For  billing  purposes,  the  Customer s  Billing  Demand  for  the  Monthly  Usage 
Demand  Charge  will  be  determined  separately  from  and  will  have  no  effect  on  the 
Billing  Demand  determined  under  Schedule  TG  that  this  tariff  complements.    The 
Monthly Usage Billing Demand shall be the maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated 
demand portion of the load that is normally supplied by the Customer s generation and 
covered by the Contract Standby Capacity that is actually supplied by the Company.  
After the Annual Grace Energy has been exhausted, all such usage shall be billed as 
Monthly Usage Billing Demand. 
 
ANNUAL GRACE ENERGY  
 
 
 
 
 
Customer  will  be  allowed  each  Year  beginning  January  1st  or  on  a  date 
mutually agreed upon by the Company and Customer, an Annual Grace Energy amount 
equal to the Standby Hours times the Contract Standby Capacity without incurring a 
Monthly Usage Demand Charge.  Energy consumption due to Customer use of Standby 
Service during a Company Non-Dispatch Period shall not count against the amount of 
Annual  Grace  Energy.    A  Company  Non-Dispatch  Period  is  defined  as  the  full  or 
partial  generation  outage  time  of  a  Customer  who  is  subject  to  a  Power  Purchase 
Agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company or its system operator 
has dispatch authority over the Customer s facilities and the Customer s facilities have 
not been dispatched by the Company or its system operator.

SCHEDULE TST 
 
ANNUAL GRACE ENERGY   Cont d 
After  the  Annual  Grace  Energy  has  been  exhausted  and  Customer  uses 
Standby Service, the Customer shall pay the Monthly Usage Demand Charge.  In a 
Billing  Month,  when  Customer  uses  Standby  Service,  the  Schedule  TG  Billing 
Demand and the Monthly Usage Billing Demand will be determined separately.  The 
Schedule  TG  Billing  Demand  will  be  the  maximum  fifteen  (15)  minute  integrated 
Kilowatt Demand determined after separating Standby Service usage from the total 
metered demands.  The date and time within each Billing Month of the Schedule TG 
Measured  Demand  may  or  may  not  be  at  the  same  date  and  time  as  the  Standby 
Monthly Usage Measured Demand.  Standby Monthly Usage Billing Demand will be 
in  addition  to  the  Billed  Demand  charges  under  the  Schedule  TG  as  previously 
described. 
 
PROVISION  FOR  CUSTOMERS  WITH  MULTIPLE  GENERATORS  AND 
SERVICES AT A SINGLE FACILITY 
In  the  event  that  the  Customer  has  installed  more  than  one  generator  and 
receives Standby Service from the Company separately for each generator s facility 
load  where  such  load  is  at  a  single  facility  for  a  single  business  on  contiguous 
property,  the  metered  load  supplied  by  the  Company  as  well  as  the  metered  load 
generated by the Customer may be aggregated for purposes of determining Contract 
Standby Capacity. 
 
CONTRACT PERIOD 
All  contracts  under  this  schedule  shall  be  for  a  minimum  period  of  one  (1) 
Year and one (1) Year periods thereafter until terminated, where service is no longer 
required, on thirty (30) days  notice.  Greater minimum periods may be required by 
contract in situations involving large or unusual loads. 
 
METER INSTALLATION 
The  Company  shall  install,  own,  operate,  and  maintain,  the  metering  to 
measure  the  electric  power  and  energy  supplied  to  Customer  to  allow  for  proper 
billing of the separate Schedule TG Service and Standby Service demands and grace 
period identified above.  In particular, the Company will install a meter that measures 
the  flow  of  power  and  energy  from  the  Customer s  own  generating  facility 
(Production  Metering).    The  Customer  shall  pay  the  Monthly  Production  Meter 
 
Charge under this schedule.

METER INSTALLATION   Cont d 
As  a  result  of  the  electrical  or  physical  configuration  of  the  Customer s 
generation  facility,  the  Company  may  determine  that  it  is  more  practical  or 
economical to use Production Metering installed and owned by the Customer, rather 
than  installing  Company-owned  metering  equipment.    If  the  Company,  at  its  sole 
discretion,  makes  such  a  determination,  then  the  Customer-owned  Production 
Metering may be used for billing purposes, so long as such metering equipment meets 
the Company s standards for quality and accuracy. 
If  through  the  course  of  the  Company s  evaluation  of  the  metering 
requirements  for  the  Production  Meter(s),  the  Company  determines,  at  its  sole 
discretion, that it is impracticable, uneconomical or unnecessary to install metering on 
the  Customer s  generator(s),  the  Company  shall  determine  the  billing  for  the 
provision of the Standby Service tariff on an un-metered and calculated basis.  This 
determination can only be made if the only electrical load located at the Customer s 
site  is  station  power  equipment  as  defined  by  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory 
Commission. 
Regardless  of  the  Company s  ultimate  determination  of  the  requirement  (or 
lack thereof) for installation of Production Metering, a meter will always be required 
at  the  Point  of  Delivery  between  the  Company  and  Customer  and  such  meter  will 
measure both delivered and received capacity and energy.

PAYMENT AND LATE PAYMENT CHARGE 
 
Bills  for  electric  service  are  due  and  payable  within  fourteen  (14)  business 
days  from  date  of  bill.    A  business  day  for  purposes  under  this  Payment  and  Late 
Payment Charge section is all non-Holiday weekdays. Any amounts in excess of fifty 
dollars ($50.00) not paid on or before three (3) business days after the due date of the 
bill shall be subject to a late payment charge of one and a half percent (1.5%) per 
Month. 
 
DETERMINATION OF BILLING DEMAND 
Billing  Demand  for  the  Production  Demand  Charge  shall  be  the  maximum 
 
simultaneous fifteen (15) minute coincident Kilowatt Demand used during the Month 
as  recorded  at  the  various  Points  of  Delivery  specified  in  the  special  contract  for 
service hereunder. 
Billing  Demand  for  the  Transmission  Demand  Charge,  for  each  individual 
 
Delivery Point, shall be the non-coincident maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated 
Kilowatt Demand used during the Month as recorded at each Delivery Point. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE 
 
Supplemental  service  to  RTD  under  this  schedule  is  applicable  to  the 
regenerative  braking  electric  production  connected  in  parallel  with  the  Company s 
transmission  system  such  that  RTD  may  generate  electric  power  and  energy  to

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RATE 
SCHEDULE EDR 
 
 
APPLICABILITY 
 
Applicable to new or existing Commercial and Industrial Customers whose electric power and 
energy  service  is  supplied  at  Secondary,  Primary,  or  Transmission  Voltage  and  who  qualify  for  an 
Economic Development Rate (EDR) as set forth in the Economic Development Rate Customer Service 
Agreement (EDR Customer Service Agreement), entered into on or before December 31, 2027, for such 
service between Customer and Company.  Available to Customers who receive electric service under the 
Company s General Service rate Schedules SG, PG, or TG.  Applicable to Supplemental Service.  Not 
applicable to Standby or Resale Service. 
 
AVAILABILITY 
 
Service hereunder is available to Commercial or Industrial Customers who: (a) agree to locate in 
Colorado and add at least three Megawatts (3 MW) of new load at a single location; or expand existing 
load in Colorado and add at least three Megawatts (3 MW) of new load at a single location; and (b) 
demonstrate, consistent with the requirements of Commission Decision No. C21-0333 in Proceeding No. 
20A-0345E and subject to review by the Commission, that the cost of electricity is a critical consideration 
in deciding where to locate new or expand existing operations and the availability of EDR, either on their 
own or in combination with other economic development incentives is a substantial factor in locating 
new or expanding existing business operations in Colorado.  Service hereunder is not available for load 
transferred from the service territory of another Colorado Public Utility (Public Utility as defined in 
C.R.S.   40-1-103).   
 
  
Standard EDR Contracts are subject to an enrollment cap of 130 MW of total eligible demand.  
For Standard EDR Contracts, the Company will submit to the Commission a notice of filing that includes: 
the executed EDR Customer Service Agreement between the Company and Customer and Customer s 
affidavit  demonstrating  Customer  is  eligible  to  take  service  under  Schedule  EDR.    All  other  EDR 
Customer Service Agreements, including those meeting the requirements for Standard EDR Contracts 
that would cause the Company to serve load in excess of the enrollment cap applicable to Standard EDR 
Contracts, are subject to Commission approval.   
 
Prior to executing an EDR Customer Service Agreement, the Company may require the Customer 
to complete a commercial credit check at the Customer s expense. The Company reserves the right to 
refuse service under this Schedule to any Customer when the Company determines in its discretion that 
serving  the  Customer  under  this  Schedule  would  pose  an  undue  business  or  financial  risk  for  the 
Company.  
  
To be eligible to enroll in and remain on Schedule EDR during the term of the EDR Customer 
Service Agreement, Customer s load shall meet the following requirements: For the first Contract Year, 
in one (1) billing cycle Customer shall have at least three Megawatts (3 MW) of load, measured by the 
maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated measured demand in such billing cycle.  For the second and 
third Contract Years, in six (6) separate billing cycles each Contract Year, Customer shall have at least 
three Megawatts (3 MW) of load, as measured by the maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated measured 
demand in such billing cycle.  For the fourth Contract Year and thereafter, as applicable, in eleven (11) 
separate billing cycles each Contract Year, Customer shall have at least three Megawatts (3 MW) of load, 
as measured by the maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated measured demand in such billing cycle.

As shown in the table above, the base rate discount applied for each Year of a Standard EDR 
Contract depends on the contract term.  Base rate discounts are applied to Distribution Demand charges, 
Generation  and  Transmission  Demand  charges, and  Energy  charges.    The  discounts  do  not  apply  to 
Service and Facility Charges.   To the extent the base rate discounts appearing in this table are revised 
during the term of a Standard EDR Contract, the base rate discounts that were in effect when the Standard 
EDR Contract was executed shall apply during the term of the Standard EDR Contract.  The Company 
and Customer may mutually agree on a base rate discount that differs from the base rate discount table 
listed above, subject to Commission approval of the Non-Standard EDR Customer Service Agreement.  
 
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STANDARD EDR CONTRACTS 
 
 
In the affidavit supporting statutory eligibility for a Standard EDR Contract, Customers entering 
into  Standard  EDR  Contracts  must  attest  that  the  customer  forecasts  that  the  cost  of  electricity  will 
constitute at least five percent of the operating costs for the new or expanded operations subject to the 
EDR discount. Alternatively, for eligible expansion of existing operations, an existing customer may 
attest that the cost of electricity is forecasted to constitute at least five percent of the EDR customer s 
total operating costs for the facility that is being expanded. 
 
 
To qualify for a Standard EDR Contract, a Customer must meet at least one of the following 
criteria: (1) participate in the Company s Interruptible Service Option Credit program; (2) participate in 
the Company s Peak Partner Rewards Program; (3) have a favorable load factor (i.e., estimated to be 
higher than the average for the applicable rate class based on the Company s last Phase II electric rate 
case); (4) have a favorable load shape (i.e., a lower ratio of total peak energy divided by total off-peak 
energy compared to the average for the applicable rate class, as estimated based on the Company s last 
Phase  II  electric  rate  case);  (5)  participate  in  a  Commission-approved  renewable  energy  program, 
equating at least 10 percent of the customer s annual energy use; or, (6) install a battery system with 
storage equal to at least 10 percent of the customer s average daily load.

MARGINAL COST DEFINITIONS 
 
Standard EDR Contract 
 
Customer Costs  
 
 
Marginal  Customer  Costs  will  be based  on  the  system  average cost for  meters, meter 
reading, billing and customer service.  The Monthly Service and Facilities charge for EDR Customers 
will also include the standard rate assessed for the Electric Affordability Program (EAP).  
 
Distribution and Transmission Costs 
 
 
The  short-term  marginal  Distribution  and  Transmission  Costs  will  be  the  cost  to 
immediately  interconnect  EDR  Customers  when  they  begin  taking  service.    The  long-term  marginal 
Distribution  and  Transmission  Costs  are  the  costs  of  advancing  the  timing  or  increasing  the  size  of 
investments for system reliability as a result of increased load.   
 
Generation Capacity Costs 
 
 
The short-term marginal Generation Capacity Costs are equal to the cost of acquiring new 
capacity to serve the EDR Customer at the time when they begin taking service, if needed.  The long-
term costs are equal to the weighted average between market capacity and the cost of a new combustion 
turbine.  The methodology used to estimate the cost of capacity will be the same as that used in the Small 
Power Production and Cogeneration Facility Policy.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RATE 
SCHEDULE EDR 
 
The  marginal  Energy  Costs  are  the  incremental  costs  associated  with  fuel,  purchased 
energy, and Variable O&M incurred to serve the additional load from EDR Customers.  The Company 
will use the Company s dispatch modeling software or other appropriate dispatch simulation software to 
calculate  the  hourly  marginal  Energy  Cost.    The  weighted  average  marginal  cost  will  be  calculated 
separately for the on and off periods as reflected in the Electric Commodity Adjustment (ECA).  The 
average deferred balance from the ECA, expressed in cents per Kilowatt-Hour (kWh), will be added to 
the on and off-peak marginal energy rates to derive the final rate (EDR ECA Factor) to be assessed to 
EDR Customers.  The marginal cost of fuel and purchased power will be assessed through the ECA and 
updated with the other rates in the ECA. 
 
Demand-Side Management (DSM) 
 
No incremental DSM costs are expected to be caused by EDR customers. 
Allocated Corporate Services 
 
The marginal cost of Allocated Corporate Services is based on increases in both sales 
volumes and revenues associated with EDR Customers as specified in the Company s Cost Assignment 
and Allocation Manual (CAAM).  
 
Taxes & Fees  
 
The marginal cost of Taxes and Fees are the standard franchise fees and taxes assessed to 
 
all utility bills.  EDR Customers will pay all applicable local taxes and franchise fees.

affected Customer for each time it fails to timely provide an estimate of 
when it expects to restore power or otherwise repair electric service to 
the Traffic Facility, and each time it fails to timely provide a required 
update. 
Upon  receipt  of  notification  from  a  Customer  of  a  Traffic  Facility 
outage  that  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Company,  the  Company  shall 
treat  such  interruption  as  an  emergency  for  purposes  of  response, 
restoration  of  service,  and  repair  of  Company  Facilities  serving  the 
affected  Traffic  Facility.    In  the  case  of  an  electric  service  outage 
affecting a Traffic Facility, the Company shall prioritize its response to 
the  outage  above  others  by  level  of  interruption.    Also,  in  allocating 
resources to respond to the Traffic Facility outage, the Company may 
consider  other  emergencies  currently  affecting  utility  service  and 
allocate resources accordingly.  Consistent with the above, the Company 
agrees  to  employ  its  best  efforts  in  responding  to  a  Traffic  Facility 
outage  and  in  restoring  and/or  repairing  Company  Facilities  affecting 
Traffic Facility outages. 
In the event the  reconfigured intersection includes Company provided 
street lighting service under Schedule SL and the Customer desires to 
provide Customer street lighting service, Customer must purchase any 
lighting equipment owned by the Company from the Company.

Point of Delivery 
With  respect  to  Schedule  ESL  only,  the  point  determined  by  mutual 
agreement at which ownership, and responsibility for operation and maintenance 
of lighting facilities, changes from the Company to the Customer and that allows 
the Company to fuse and or electrically separate the Company s Facilities from 
the Customer s facilities. 
 
SERVICE CONVERSION AND CONNECTION 
 
The  Customer  shall  be  responsible  for  all  actual  costs  that  the  Company 
demonstrates  are  reasonably  necessary  to  convert  the  Company s  Facilities  to 
accomplish  the  sale  and  transfer  of  lighting  facilities  from  the  Company  to  the 
Customer,  which  may  include  the  labor,  equipment  and  overhead  costs  to  track  the 
conductor in the field and to verify that no other equipment is attached.  Beginning at 
the  time  that  conversion  to  municipal  ownership  is  first accomplished, the Customer 
shall provide and maintain identification markers on each pole or arm, if only the arm is 
transferred, that clearly designates the light unit as owned by the Customer and served 
under Schedule ESL.  The  Customer and the Company shall each be responsible for 
their respective dispatch and identification costs. 
 
When requested by the Company, the Customer shall install, own and operate 
the pull box and Company shall make terminations and fusing within the pull box to 
energize the lighting circuit.  In the event that a pull box location is not available due to 
physical constraints as reasonably determined by the Company and the Customer, the 
Point  of  Delivery  shall  be  the  wire  into  the  foundation  or  pole  depending  on  the 
installation type.  Subsequent to the initial installation where a pull box is not installed, 
if the lighting pole/foundation requires repair or replacement and circumstances have 
changed that now reasonably permit the installation of a pull box, Customer shall install 
a pull box in accordance with Company specifications.

In  unique  circumstances  where  the  Company  determines  that  a  pull  box  or  a 
lighting  pole/foundation  is  not  acceptable,  the  Company  and  the  Customer  may 
mutually determine the Point of Delivery at another location other than at a pull box or 
lighting pole/foundation.

This  section  is  applicable  to  municipalities  within  the  Company s  service 
Burn Out Rate: 
For municipalities that choose to receive the sampling services and bill 
credits as described herein, the Company shall conduct, in cooperation with the 
Customer, annual sampling studies of Company-owned streetlights being paid 
for by the Customer.  The statistical samples required to estimate the Company-
owned streetlight burn-out rates by municipality will be designed with a ninety 
percent (90%) confidence that the sample estimate will be within plus or minus 
two percent (  2%) of the burn-out rate of the population being sampled. 
Alternatively, the Company and the Customer may mutually agree upon 
a more targeted sampling methodology.  The Company shall stagger the annual 
sampling studies it conducts for those Customers that have elected to receive 
service  under  these  provisions  scheduling  them  to  occur  at  least  once  every 
 
twelve  (12)  Months  for  each  Customer  between  October  1  and  March  31  of 
each Year.

RATE 
For each sampling study which shows that more than two percent (2%) 
of Company-owned street lights are not operating, the Company may request 
permission to conduct a re-sampling study in cooperation with the Customer, 
but the re-sampling may not occur sooner than thirty (30) days following the 
date of the most recent sampling study or re-sampling study. The resample shall 
occur  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  Customer s  receipt  of  the  Company s 
request  to  conduct  a  resample,  unless  otherwise  mutually  agreed.    If  the 
Company and the Customer are unable to conduct the resample within this time, 
and the delay is attributable solely to the unavailability of the Customer, the bill 
credit owing as a result of the prior sampling study shall cease in the following 
Month.  If the re-sampling shows that less than or equal to two percent (2%) of 
the Company-owned street lights are not operating, the bill credit owing as a 
result of the prior sampling study shall cease in the following Month.  If the re-
sampling study shows that more than two percent (2%) of the Company-owned 
street lights are not operating, but at a different percentage than shown in the 
prior sampling study or re-sampling study, the amount of the future payments to 
the  Customer  shall  be  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  percentage  in  the 
current  re-sampling  study,  and  shall  go  into  effect  the  Month  following  the 
resample. 
The Customer is also authorized to require one re-sampling if the annual 
sampling study shows an outage rate that exceeds one and seven tenths percent 
(1.7%).  The re-sampling shall be conducted within thirty (30) days following 
the Company s receipt of a request to resample from the Customer and may be 
scheduled at any time from three (3) to nine (9) Months following the annual 
sampling study. 
Any outages above the two percent (2%) threshold shall be addressed as 
described  above,  with  the  same  remedies  applying  to  outages  exceeding  two 
percent (2%) as demonstrated in the initial sampling study.

If the results of the sampling study show that the Company-owned street 
light burn out rate exceeds two percent (2%), then the Company shall reduce 
the Customer s total street light bill for service delivered under this tariff by the 
percentage, rounded to the nearest one tenth of one percent, that the burn out 
rate exceeds two percent (2%).   For example, a three and two-tenths percent 
(3.2%) outage rate will result in a one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) discount 
per  Month  for  each  Month  until  the  Company s  re-sampling  shows  that  the 
outage rate has fallen to two percent (2%) or below. 
Restoration of Street Light Service: 
The Company shall, upon receiving notice of a Company-owned street 
light  not  being  operational,  use  its  best  efforts  to  repair  the  Company-owned 
street light to an operational condition within five (5) days of receiving notice.  
On  the  fifteenth  (15th)  of  every  Month,  the  Company  shall  provide  Monthly 
reports to the Commission and to each municipality electing to receive service 
under these municipal provisions detailing the Company s actual performance 
for the past Month as to such municipality.  The report will be accompanied by 
any supporting documentation reasonably required by the municipality to verify 
the results of the report.  On the fifteenth (15th) of every Month, the Company 
shall provide to the Commission and to each municipality electing to receive 
service  under  these  municipal  provisions  a  report  detailing  the  Company s 
actual  performance  for  the  previous  Month  and  the  previous  twelve  (12) 
calendar Months (including the reported Month) for such municipality. 
Street Lighting Service Restoration   Bill Credit: 
The  Company  shall  provide  a  bill  credit  equal  to  six  and  five-tenths 
percent  (6.5%)  of  the  previous  Month s  non-routine  maintenance  charges  if 
greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Company-owned street lights reported 
during the previous twelve (12) Months were not repaired within five (5) days.

INTERRUPTIBLE SERVICE OPTION CREDIT 
SCHEDULE ISOC 
 
 
PART A 
 
APPLICABILITY 
Applicable as an interruptible service option to Customers who receive electric service under the 
Company s General Service rate Schedules SG, PG or TG, including Customers that elect optional Net 
Metering  Service  under  Schedule  NM  that  have  agreed  to  pay  for  necessary  metering  to  measure  the 
interruptible  load.    Not  applicable  to  Customers  who  receive  electric  service  under  the  Company s 
Standby Service rate Schedules SST, PST, or TST. 
As of January 1, 2019, service under this tariff is no longer being offered under the One Hour 
Notice  option.    Customers  who  had  service  under  this  tariff  under  the  One  Hour  Notice  option  may 
convert their service to the 10 Minute Notice option which is available under Part C.  Customers under 
the One Hour Notice Option who convert the 10 Minute Option prior to January 1, 2019 will qualify for 
Service under Part B. 
 
AVAILABILITY 
Optional  service  under  this  rate  schedule  is  available  to  Customers  that  have  entered  into  a 
written,  signed  and  dated  Interruptible  Service  Option  Agreement  that  specifies  the  Contract  Firm 
Demand, as well as the Customer specific data necessary for the Company to calculate the Customer s 
Monthly Credit as set forth below. 
To  qualify  under  this  schedule,  a  Customer  must  have  a  Contract  Interruptible  Load  of  three 
hundred  (300)  Kilowatts  or  greater,  as  defined  below.    Also,  Customer  must  achieve  an  Interruptible 
Demand of at least three hundred (300) kW during each of the four (4), summer peak season Months of 
June, July, August and September of the prior Year, or, if the Customer is a new Customer or did not take 
service from the Company during the prior Year at the premises which the Customer desires to include on 
the ISOC program, Customer must demonstrate, to the Company s satisfaction, that it is likely to achieve 
an  Interruptible  Demand  of  at  least  three  hundred  (300)  kW  during  each  of  the  summer  peak  season 
Months of the current Year. 
Customers receiving service under the within ten (10) minute notice provision of this schedule 
must provide the Company with physical control of their interruptible load.  Physical control for purposes 
of  this  schedule  shall  include  control  through  Company  switches  and  control  through  the  Customer s 
Energy Management System (EMS).  EMS is defined broadly to be any automatic Customer-owned or 
leased system capable of controlling the Customer s interruptible load by means of an electronic or digital 
signal  initiated  by  the  Company.    Before  the  Company  will  accept  physical  control  through  the 
Customer s EMS, the Customer must provide an independent engineering assessment, acceptable to the 
Company,  demonstrating  that  the  Customer s  EMS  will  reliably  respond  to  Company s  interruption 
signal.  Customer must update this assessment annually on the ISOC Contract anniversary date.

The Company shall calculate the Contract Interruptible Load Planning and Operating Reserves 
before January 1st of each Year.  If the Company determines that the Contract Interruptible Load for 
Planning Reserves is less than three hundred Kilowatts (300 kW), then the Interruptible Service Option 
Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current calendar Year.  Customers in their second through 
nth  Year  on  this  schedule  may  have  certain  daily  peak  Demands  described  above,  which  occur  on

CILPlan or CILOpr by one hundred Kilowatts (100 kW) or more, the Customer may request that the 
 
Company determine its Contract Interruptible Load for Planning Reserves for the next Year based on 
 
its maximum daily one (1)-hour integrated kW Demands occurring between the hours of noon and 8:00

INTERRUPTIBLE SERVICE OPTION CREDIT 
When  the  Company  directs  the  Customer  to  interrupt  its  available  Interruptible  Load  for 
capacity and/or contingency interruptions, the Customer must reduce its load to the level of Customer s 
Contract Firm Demand, or the appropriate penalties will be enforced. 
 
ECONOMIC INTERRUPTIONS 
The Company reserves the right to call an Economic Interruption for one or more Customers 
once per day when the Company believes, in its sole discretion, that calling an interruption will lower 
its  overall  system  costs  compared  to  what  the  overall  system  cost  would  be  in  the  absence  of  the 
interruption. The duration of any Economic Interruption shall not be less than four (4) hours, unless a 
Customer has opted to waive the four (4) hour minimum.  In addition, the Company may call a single 
interruption equal to the Customer s remaining hours available for interruption, for any Customer who 
has less than four (4) hours of interruption available. Customers under the within ten (10) minute and 
one (1) hour notice provisions will have at least one (1) hour notice of an Economic Interruption.

weighted average cost, as determined by the Company s Cost Calculator or its successor, plus three (3) 
 
mils per kWh, for the block of electricity used to serve the Customer(s) who elected to buy-through. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this calculation, the Company shall assume that the block of electricity used is 
the highest cost block of electricity consumed in each buy-through hour.  Customers who elect to buy-
through the Economic Interruption must continue to buy-through all hours of the interruption period 
unless  the  Company  notifies  Customers  of  an  updated  buy-through  price  for  any  hour  of  the 
interruption that exceeds the original estimated buy-through price for the hour in question, whereupon 
any  Customer  that  elected  initially  to  buy-through  the  Economic  Interruption  will  have  fifteen  (15) 
minutes after being notified of the updated estimated price to advise the Company that such Customer 
desires  to  be  interrupted  at  the  start  of  the  next  hour.    Once  a  Customer  chooses  to  interrupt,  the 
Customer  will  be  interrupted  for  the  remainder  of  the  interruption  period  as  determined  by  the 
Company.  The minimum duration of any Economic Interruption under this Paragraph shall be four (4) 
hours from the time that the Company designated when it first called for the Economic Interruption.

BUY THROUGH   ECONOMIC INTERRUPTIONS   Cont d 
If the Company chooses to extend an Economic Interruption from the original notification, all 
ISOC Customers affected by Economic Interruption will be notified and given the opportunity to buy-
through  or  interrupt  for  the  duration  of  the  Economic  Interruption  extension  period.  Economic 
Interruption extensions may be less than four (4) hours in duration. 
Customers  may  provide  advance  election  to  buy-though  up  through  a  specified  price.    Such 
election shall be made no later than the last business day prior to the first day of the Month to which the 
election will apply  and  shall be delivered to the Customer s Xcel Energy  Service Representative by 
electronic mail.  Any Customer with a standing buy-though order shall have the option, up to forty-five 
(45)  minutes  before  the  start  of  an  event  to  advise  the  Company  that  it  desires  to  be  interrupted.  
Further, in the event that the buy-though price exceeds the Customer-specified price, the Customer may 
nevertheless elect to buy-though the interruption by providing the Company with the required notice up 
to forty-five (45) minutes before the start of an event. 
 
FAILURE TO INTERRUPT   ECONOMIC INTERRUPTIONS 
In the event that any Customer fails to interrupt during an Economic Interruption, the Customer 
will  be  deemed  by  the  Company  to  have  failed  to  interrupt  for  all  Demand  that  the  Customer  was 
obligated to interrupt but did not interrupt. 
The failure-to-interrupt charge shall be equal to the highest incremental price for power during 
the Economic Interruption plus three (3) mils, as determined by the Company after the fact, including 
market costs, unit start-up cost, spinning reserve costs and reserve penalty cost, if any. The charge will 
only apply to the portion of the load the Customer fails to interrupt. 
 
CAPACITY INTERRUPTIONS 
The Company reserves the right to call a Capacity Interruption for one or more Customers at 
any time when the Company believes, in its sole discretion, that generation or transmission capacity is 
not  sufficiently  available  to  serve  its  firm  load  obligations  other  than  obligations  to  make  intra-day 
energy sales.  The duration of any Capacity Interruption shall not be less than four (4) hours, unless a 
Customer has opted to waive the four (4) hour minimum duration.  In addition, a single interruption of 
less than four (4) hours is permitted if a Customer has less than four (4) hours of interruption available 
to use the remaining hours. 
 
CONTINGENCY INTERRUPTION 
The Company reserves the right to call a Contingency Interruption for one or more Customers 
receiving  service  under  the  within  ten  (10)  minute  notice  provision  at  any  time  when  the  Company 
believes, in its sole discretion, that interruption is necessary for the Company to be able to meet its 
disturbance control standard (DCS) criteria.  The duration of any Contingency Interruption shall not be 
less than four (4) hours, unless a Customer has opted to waive the four (4) hour minimum duration.  In 
addition, a single interruption of less than four (4) hours is permitted if a Customer has less than four 
(4) hours of interruption available to use the remaining hours.

FAILURE TO INTERRUPT   CAPACITY & CONTINGENCY INTERRUPTIONS 
In  the  event  a  Customer  who  is  directed  to  interrupt  fails  to  interrupt  during  a  capacity  or 
contingency  interruption,  the  Customer  shall  pay  the  Company  fifty  percent  (50%)  percent  of  the 
Customer s expected annual credit for all Demand that the Customer was obligated to interrupt but did 
not interrupt.  The penalty will apply only to the portion of the load that the Customer fails to interrupt.  
After  the  Customer  fails  to  interrupt  twice,  the  Company  shall  have  the  option  to  cancel  the 
Interruptible Service Option Agreement.  If the contract is cancelled, the Customer shall not be eligible 
for service under this rate schedule for a minimum of one (1) Year, and the Customer will not be liable 
for the Early Termination Penalty. 
For  determining  compliance  after  capacity  and  contingency  interruptions,  the  first  and  last 
fifteen  (15)  minute  interval  of  each  event  shall  not  be  considered.    If  a  Customer s  violation  for  a 
capacity or contingency interruption is less than sixty (60) minutes in duration not including the first 
and last control period intervals, then the Customer s penalty shall be reduced by seventy-five percent 
(75%) if the violation is fifteen (15) minutes or shorter, shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%) if the 
violation is sixteen (16) to thirty (30) minutes in duration and shall be reduced by twenty-five percent 
(25%) if the violation is thirty-one (31) to fifty-nine (59) minutes.  This provision does not apply to 
Economic Interruptions. 
If  a  within  ten  (10)  minute  notice  option  Customer  utilizing  equipment  where  the  Company 
physically controls the Customer s load through the operation of  a Company installed, operated  and 
owned  disconnect  switch,  violates  a  capacity  or  contingency  interruption  the  Customer  shall  not  be 
penalized  unless  evidence  of  tampering  or  bypassing  the  direct  load  control  of  the  Company  is  in 
evidence.  If tampering or bypassing the direct load control of the Company is evident, the Company 
may remove the Customer from the within ten (10) minute notice option and place the Customer on the 
one (1) hour notice option rate for a minimum one (1) Year period. The Customers  credits shall be 
adjusted accordingly.  In addition, the Customer shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the annual credit rate 
times the amount of load that the Customer failed to remove as a penalty. 
If a within than ten (10) minute notice option Customer utilizing equipment where the Company 
provides  a  signal  to  the  Customer  and  the  Customer s  equipment  is  used  to  reduce  load  violates  a 
capacity or contingency interruption, the Customer shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the annual credit 
rate  times  the  amount  of  load  that  the  Customer  failed  to  remove  as  a  penalty  and  in  addition  the 
Company  may  remove  the  Customer  from  the  within  ten  (10)  minute  notice  option  and  place  the 
Customer on the one (1) hour notice option rate for a minimum one (1) Year period.  The Customer s 
credits shall be adjusted accordingly. 
 
PHONE LINE REQUIREMENTS 
All ISOC Customers will be required to install a dedicated Company specified phone line to the 
meter location.  The Customer s phone line must be installed and working before the Customer may 
receive service under this tariff. The Company may elect to obtain the phone line for within ten (10) 
minute notice Customers with the cost charged to the Customer.

Customers  may  choose  to  utilize  their  own  EMS  automated  intelligent  equipment  to 
 
reduce load down to the Contract Firm Demand level when requested by the Company.  
 
Customer  will  pay  for  the  cost  of  a  remote  terminal  unit  (RTU)  that  will  receive  the 
 
interruption and restore signals via phone or cellular communication.  The RTU shall be 
 
designed, purchased, installed and tested by the Company or Company contractor at the 
 
Customer s  expense.  The  Customer  must  demonstrate  that  their  automated  EMS 
 
intelligent  device/equipment  will  receive  the  Company s  signal  and  automatically  act 
upon that signal to remove load down to the Contract Firm Demand Level within a time 
 
period to be specified in the Interruptible Service Option Credit Agreement. A $1,000 
non-refundable deposit is required to perform the engineering and design work required 
to determine the costs associated with purchasing and installing the RTU. 
Customers may choose to utilize a Company-owned and operated switch.  The Company 
owned  switch  removes  the  Customer s  entire  load  during  a  capacity  or  contingency 
interruption.  The Customer must pay for the cost of the Company-owned switch and 
RTU  that  will  receive  the  interruption  and  restore  signals  via  phone  or  cellular 
communication  and  lock  the  Customer s  load  out  during  a  capacity  or  contingency 
interruption.  The remote terminal unit shall be designed, purchased, installed and tested 
by  the  Company  at  the  Customer s  expense.    A  $1,000  non-refundable  deposit  is 
required  to  perform  the  engineering  and  design  work  needed  to  determine  the  costs 
associated with providing the Company physical control over the Customer's load.  A 
minimum  of  six  (6)  Months  is  required  to  design,  order,  install  and  test  the  required 
equipment to give the Company control over the Customer's load.  During a capacity or 
contingency interruption, the Company shall lock out the Customer s load to prevent the 
Customer from terminating the interruption before release.  Sub-Option two (2) is not 
available to Customers receiving secondary service from the Company.

Customers shall be paid a Monthly credit for Planning Reserves, the MCRPlan, plus a Monthly 
 
MONTHLY CREDIT FOR PLANNING AND OPERATING RESERVES 
 
Credit for Operating Reserves, the MCROpr. 
 
The MCRPlan credit shall be calculated by multiplying the MCRPlan rate times the lesser of the 
Customer s Contract Interruptible Load for Planning Reserves or the actual Interruptible Demand for 
Planning Reserves during the billing Month. 
 
The  MCROpr  credit  shall  be  calculated  by  multiplying  the  MCROpr  Rate  for  Operating 
Reserves  by  the  lesser  of  the  Customer s  Contract  Interruptible  Load  for  Operating  Reserves  or  the 
actual Interruptible Demand for Operating Reserves during the billing Month. 
The MCRPlan and MCROpr rate shall vary by season.  The Summer Season shall be June 1 
 
through September 30, and the Winter Season shall be October 1 through May 31.  The MCRPlan rate 
shall be calculated separately for each Customer using the following equation: 
 
MONTHLY CREDIT RATE FOR PLANNING RESERVES 
 
Summer Monthly Credit, per kW- Month: 
MCRPlan =[($7.63 * Ca) + ($-0.00028 * Ha)] * Slf * 115% 
Winter Monthly Credit, per kW- Month: 
 
MCRPlan =[($7.63 * Ca) + ($-0.00028 * Ha)] * Slf * 92.5% 
 
MONTHLY CREDIT FOR OPERATING RESERVES 
 
 
 
Summer Monthly Credit, per kW- Month:

CALCULATION OF BILLING FOR NET METERING SERVICE 
 
General Provisions: 
Net  Metering  shall  be,  for  billing  purposes,  the  net  electric  consumption  as 
measured at the Company s Service Meter.  However, in the event Net Metering is 
negative  such  that  the  Retail  Renewable  Distributed  Generation  Resource s 
production is greater than the Customer s consumption in any Month, the Company 
will not credit Customer for such Negative Consumption.  The Excess Energy shall be 
considered  as  energy  available  to  offset  consumption  in  subsequent  Months.  
However,  in  the  event  that  such  Excess  Energy  balance  remains  at  the  end  of  a 
Calendar Year, Company will pay Customer for such Negative Consumption balance 
at the rate that reflects the Company s AHIC of electricity supply over the most recent 
Calendar Year, as defined as the Cash  Out Option.  Payment shall be made within 
sixty (60) days of the end of each Calendar Year, or within sixty (60) days of when 
the Customer terminates its retail service. 
Customer may make a one-time election in writing, defined as the Roll Over 
Option, to have the Company carry forward the Customer s Excess Energy as a dollar 
credit  from  Month  to  Month  indefinitely  until  the  Customer  terminates  service,  at 
which  time  no  payment  shall  be  made  by  the  Company  for  any  remaining  Excess 
Energy balance.

Treatment of Excess Energy for Time-of-Use Rate Schedules: 
 
Cash Out Option: 
 
For  any  Customer  who  is  net  metered  and  on  a  service  schedule  featuring 
time-differentiated  base  energy  charges,  the  Company  will  track  the  Customer s 
Excess Energy by the time period that the energy was generated (On Peak, Shoulder, 
or Off Peak, as applicable).  Inside of a billing period, excess On Peak energy may be 
utilized to offset either Shoulder or Off Peak energy, and excess Shoulder energy may 
be utilized to offset Off Peak energy.  Across billing periods, the Company will first 
apply accumulated excess On Peak energy to the On Peak period if the Customer has 
On Peak net consumption, then apply any remaining excess On Peak energy to the 
Shoulder  energy  or  Off  Peak  energy,  as  applicable.    Shoulder  energy  will  first  be 
applied to Shoulder Month consumption, then applied to Off Peak consumption.  At 
the  end  of  the  Year,  any  remaining  Excess  Energy  shall  be  compensated  at  the 
Average Hourly Incremental Cost (AHIC).   
 
Roll Over Option: 
 
For any Customer who is net metered, the Company will track the Customer s 
Excess Energy by the time period that the energy was generated (On Peak, Shoulder, 
or  Off  Peak,  as  applicable  to  customers  on  time-differentiated  rate  schedules).  A 
Customer s Excess Energy by billing period will then be multiplied by the prevailing 
total energy rate (base energy rate plus riders assessed on a per-kWh basis) for the 
same  time  period  that  the  Excess  Energy  was  generated  (On  Peak,  Shoulder,  Off 
Peak, as applicable to customers on time-differentiated rate schedules) to determine a 
dollar credit.  This credit will then be used to offset the Customer s bill for electric 
service, except for the Service and Facilities charge.  To the extent that a remaining 
credit exists, it will roll from Month-to-Month in perpetuity until the Customer leaves 
the premise at which time no additional compensation will be provided.

ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS WITH PV 
 
Customers  may  elect  to  own,  operate,  and  maintain  their  PV  System  in 
conjunction  with  an  Energy  Storage  System  consistent  with  technical  guidance  as 
posted  to  the  Company s  web  site.    If  the  Customer s  Energy  Storage  System  is 
charged solely by the renewable generation, the Customer s Energy Storage System 
may participate in the Company s Net Metering Service; otherwise, if charged by any 
other  source,  except  for,  inadvertent  or  de  minimis  exports,  the  Energy  Storage 
System must not export power through the Service Meter. 
The configuration of the Customer s Energy Storage System consistent with 
the Company approved configuration may affect the production of RECs due to the 
losses associated with the operation of the Energy Storage System.  If the Customer 
chooses a configuration that result in a reduction of REC production, as measured by 
the Company s meter or meters, approval of the installation will be contingent on the 
Customer s acceptance of the reduction of RECs.   
 
For  Customers  who  choose  to  design  and  implement  an  Energy  Storage 
System  that  is  paired  with  their  PV  on  the  PV  side  of  the  Production  Meter,  the 
Company  will  require  an  additional  meter  where  applicable  in  conformance  with 
Company standards to assess any load that is served from the generation side of the 
Production  Meter  and  to  measure  RECs  when  appropriate.    The  Customer  will  be 
responsible for a Load Meter Charge as found on their applicable service schedule.

An Allocation is the Monthly allocation of photovoltaic energy that the 
SRC Producers determine for a SRCS Subscriber that the Company converts 
to Kilowatt-Hours for each billing Month. 
The Kilowatt-Hour SRCS Allocation is determined from the Monthly 
meter measurement of the SRCS Producer s photovoltaic energy production as 
measured and recorded by the Company.  The Company shall use the SRCS 
Allocation for each SRCS Subscriber to determine the Monthly SRCS Credit. 
from 
photovoltaic  service  under  Rate  Schedule  PV  cannot  exceed  one-hundred-
twenty  percent  (120%)  of  a  SRCS  Subscriber s  average  Monthly  Kilowatt-

Month period. 
The  Kilowatt-Hour  SRCS  Allocations  plus  production 
Any  SRCS  Allocations, 
in  combination  with  production  from 
photovoltaic  service  under  Rate  Schedule  PV,  which  exceeds  one-hundred-
twenty percent (120%) of a SRCS Subscriber s annual energy usage, shall not 
be included in the SRCS Credit.   
The Subscriber must be in the same county or qualified under criteria 
otherwise  determined  by  the  Company,  to  be  deemed  eligible  subscribers.  
SRCS Allocations may be transferred between eligible subscribers with sixty 
(60)  days   notice  and  up  to  three  transfers  per  calendar  Year.    New  SRCS 
Subscriptions  resulting  from  SRCS  Allocation  transfers  are  subject  to  the 
same one-hundred-twenty percent (120%) rule. 
In  the  event  the  production  from  SRCS  Producer  is  reduced  due  to 
weather  or  equipment  failure,  or  other  cause,  the  resulting  Monthly  SRCS 
Credit,  which  is  determined  from  actual  meter  readings,  will  likewise  be 
reduced.

ELECTRIC AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM (EAP) 
 
AVAILABILITY 
 
 
The Electric Affordability Program (Program) is available to residential Customers who have 
been  qualified  for  and  receive assistance  from  the  Low-Income  Energy  Assistance  Program (LEAP) 
during the federal fiscal Year (Program Year).  Further, such Customers must agree to be placed on the 
Company s Average  Monthly  Payment  Plan (AMPP)  and  must  also agree  to a  payment  schedule  as 
described below to be considered a Qualified Customer.  Only Customers receiving a financial benefit 
as set forth herein shall be considered a Qualified Customer. 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND BILL IMPACT FOR QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS 
The  Program  has  two  components:  1)  Affordability  and,  2)  Arrearage  Forgiveness.    The 
Company  will  review  a  Customer s  billing  and  consumption  information  for  the  most  recent  twelve 
(12) Month period, or estimate usage for Qualified Customers with no usage history, approved LEAP 
benefits  and  household  income  information  as  submitted  to  the  Company  to  determine  a  Qualified 
Customer s financial benefit and payment schedule amount under the AMPP.  A Qualified Customer s 
payment  schedule  shall  include  both  payment  of  their  current  Month s  bill  after  inclusion  of  the 
affordability bill credit, and payment of a portion of the Qualified Customer s pre-Program arrears, if 
any. 
 
Affordability Options 
a) 
The Percentage of Income Payment Plan (PIPP) Affordability option consists of a bill 
credit determined as one-twelfth of the difference between the Company s estimate of 
the  Qualified  Customer s  annual  electric  bill  and  three  percent  (3%)  of  the  Qualified 
Customer s  annual  household  income  as  provided  by  the  Colorado  Department  of 
Human  Services,  Division  of  Low  Income  Energy  Assistance  to  Company.    This  bill 
credit is a Program cost that will be included in the Tracker Account. Any LEAP benefit 
shall  not  be  considered in  the  calculation  of  the  PIPP  affordability  credit.  Any  LEAP 
benefit shall be applied to that portion of the Qualified Customer s full annual bill that 
exceeds the Qualified Customer s affordable percentage of income payment. Any LEAP 
benefit not applied to the Qualified Customer s current bill will be applied to a Qualified 
Customer s arrears. No portion of any LEAP benefit provided to a Qualified Customer 
may be applied to the account of a Customer other than the Qualified Customer to whom 
the LEAP benefit was rendered.

The Step Bill Discount (SBD) Affordability option discounts the Qualified Customer s 
bill at standard residential rates at twenty percent (20%) or twenty-five percent (25%).  
The SBD Affordability component is available to Qualified Customers whose bills as a 
percentage  of  income  are  less  than  the  three  percent  (3%)  of  income  required  by  the 
PIPP Affordability option.  The SBD option is offered to Customers with a household 
income at or below 185 percent of the current federal poverty level and who otherwise 
meet  the  eligibility  criteria  set  forth  in  rules  of  the  Colorado  Department  of  Human 
Services adopted pursuant to   40-8.5-105, C.R.S. 
 
LEAP Benefits may not be considered in the calculation of the SBD affordability 
credit.    Any  LEAP  benefit  not  applied  to  a  Qualified  Customer s  current  bill  will  be 
applied to a Qualified Customer s arrears. This SBD bill credit is a Program cost that 
will be included in the Tracker Account. 
 
Qualified Customers who report a monthly income of zero dollars ($0.00) shall pay ten 
dollars ($10.00) each month towards their current bill and must re-verify their income 
every  four  (4)  Months  to  continue  in  the  Program.    In  the  event  that  a  Qualified 
Customer fails to re-verify their income they shall be suspended from the Program until 
the earlier of the date that the Company receives a re-verification or the expiration of the 
Program Year.  If a re-verification is not received before the expiration of the Program 
Year the Qualified Customer will be removed from the Program.

the PIPP Arrearage Forgiveness Component shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the 
Qualified Customer s annual income.  The credit will be designed to retire pre-Program 
arrears over a period of twelve (12) months for Qualified Customers with arrears of five 
hundred dollars ($500.00) or less and twenty-four (24) months for Qualified Customers 
with  arrears  of  more  than  five  hundred  dollars  ($500.00).    This  PIPP  arrearage 
forgiveness credit is a Program cost that will be included in the Tracker Account. 
The SBD Arrearage Forgiveness component consists of a one-time credit of up to two 
hundred dollars ($200.00) that will be applied to the Qualified Customer s arrears.  SBD 
participants  are  not  required  to  repay  this  SBD  arrearage  credit.    This  SBD  arrearage 
forgiveness credit is a Program cost that will be included in the Tracker Account.

Regardless  of  arrears  balances,  the  Company  agrees  to  maintain  service  and  suspend 
 
collection  activities  under  the  Discontinuance  of  Service  by  Company  section  to 
T 
Qualified Customers if they maintain their payment schedule hereunder.  
 
With  respect  to  payment  default  provisions,  a  single  missed,  partial  or  late  payment 
 
within  any  Program  Year  shall  not  result  in  the  automatic  removal  of  a  Qualified 
T 
Customer from the Program.  However, two (2) or more missed, partial or late payments 
 
within any Program Year will result in the Company initiating its regular collection and 
 
Discontinuance of Service process. 
 
Qualified Customers must maintain an active Company account for electric service in 
 
said Customer s name at their permanent primary residence only to be eligible for the 
T 
Program.  In the event the Qualified Customer resides at a primary residence, wherein 
 
such  Qualified  Customer  is  not  the  Customer  of  record,  and  conditioned  upon  the 
 
residence being qualified under LEAP, the Company will allow such a Customer to be 
 
eligible for the Program. 
 
Qualified  Customers  agree  to  notify  the  Company  of  any  change  of  address.    Such  a 
 
change  may  result  in  revisions  to  the  Qualified  Customer s  payment  amounts  and 
MT 
schedules  or  removal  from  the  Program,  as  determined  by  Company.    Additionally, 
 
Qualified Customers who do not continue to qualify under the provisions herein may be 
 
removed from the Program by the Company.

COMPANY PROGRAM FUNDING 
a) 
b) 
If there is an over-recovered balance in the Tracker Account at the end of a Year, the 
over-recovered balance may be rolled over to the subsequent Year and can be used to 
supplement benefits in the subsequent Year unless the Commission orders otherwise. 
The  Company  shall  include  as  a  part  of  the  Service  and  Facility  Charge  for  all  rate 
schedules,  or  as  a  part  of  the  Monthly  Rate  for  rate  schedules  without  Service  and 
Facility  Charge,  an  amount  as  approved  by  the  Commission  to  recover  the  costs 
associated with the Company s EAP.  The Company shall revise the Service and Facility 
Charge  or  the  Monthly  rate,  for  all  rate  schedules  as  applicable  based  on  the  costs 
incurred and revenue collected for the Program. 
 
A permanent tracking mechanism (Tracker Account) will be established to provide for tracking 
the  amounts  recovered  to  fund  the  Program  as  compared  to  the  actual  Program  expenditures.  The 
Tracker  Account  balance  (positive  or  negative)  shall  be  provided  to  the  Commission  on  an  annual 
basis.  The Company may petition the Commission to adjust its Service and Facilities Charges in order 
to adjust the Tracker Account balance as part of a Phase II rate case proceeding or by filing a verified 
application.

SCHEDULE RE 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Recycled Energy 
 
Recycled  Energy  is  energy  produced  by  a  RE  Generation  facility 
connected in parallel with the Company s electric system and located on the 
Customer s  Site  that  converts  the  otherwise  lost  energy  from  the  heat  from 
exhaust  stacks  or  pipes  to  electricity  and  that  does  not  combust  additional 
fossil fuel.  Recycled Energy does not include energy produced by any system 
that uses energy, lost or otherwise from a process whose primary purpose is 
the  generation  of  electricity,  including,  without  limitation,  any  process 
involving engine-driven generation or pumped hydroelectricity generation. 
 
In  instances  where  the  proposed  RE  Generation  capacity  rating  is 
greater  than  the  service  entrance  or  the  Company s  electric  system  capacity 
and the Customer desires to install such RE Generation thereby requiring the 
Company to increase such capacity or make electric system modifications to 
accommodate  the  additional  generation,  the  Customer  shall  submit  to  the 
Company  a  written  request  to  connect  the  RE  Generation  facility  to  the 
Company s  electric  system.  The  Company  shall  then  address  the  request 
pursuant to its small generator interconnection process.  The Customer shall 
be responsible for all interconnection costs as determined from the results of 
the small generator interconnection process. 
 
Site 
 
The  Customer s  Site  shall  include  all  contiguous  property  owned  or 
leased by the Customer, without regard to interruptions in contiguity caused 
by  easements,  public  thoroughfares,  transportation  rights-of-ways,  or  utility 
rights-of-way.    RE  systems  may  be  located  on  or  adjacent  to  a  Customer s 
Site, as long as the RE system is behind the Customer s meter and does not 
serve  any  other  Customers.  RE  systems  may  also  serve  multiple  facilities 
belonging to the same Customer if the facilities are behind the same meter. 
Production Meter   
 
An  electric  meter  installed,  owned,  operated  and  maintained  by  the 
Company  to  measure  the  electric  power  and  energy  produced  by  the 
Customer s  RE  Generation.  Customer  shall  allow  adequate  access  to  the 
 
Company to operate and maintain the Production Meter. 
Customer s Total Load 
The Customer s Total Load shall be determined by meter measurement 
 
of the total capacity requirements of the Customer, regardless of whether such 
capacity  is  supplied  by  the  Company,  the  Customer s  own  generation 
equipment, or a combination of both.

applicable,  plus  the  Distribution  Standby  Capacity  Fee  plus  the 
Generation and Transmission Standby Capacity Reservation Fee. 
 
Transmission Monthly Minimum: 
The  Service  and  Facility  Charge  plus  the  Production  Meter  Charge  if 
applicable,  plus  the  Interconnection  Charge  plus  the  Generation  and 
Transmission Standby Capacity Reservation Fee. 
This rate schedule is subject to all applicable Electric Rate Adjustments as on 
 
ADJUSTMENTS 
 
file and in effect in this Electric Tariff. 
 
PAYMENT AND LATE PAYMENT CHARGE 
 
Bills for electric service are due and payable within fourteen (14) business days 
from date of bill.  A business day for purposes under this Payment and Late Payment 
Charge section is all non-Holiday weekdays.  Any amounts in excess of fifty dollars 
($50.00) not paid on or before three (3) business days after the due date of the bill shall 
be subject to a late payment charge of one and one half percent (1.5%) per Month. 
 
DETERMINATION OF DISTRIBUTION STANDBY CAPACITY FEE PAYMENT 
 
The  Distribution  Standby  Capacity  Fee  Payment  shall  be  determined  by 
multiplying  the  Contract  Standby  Capacity  times  the  Distribution  Standby  Capacity 
Fee. 
 
DETERMINATION  OF  GENERATION  AND  TRANSMISSION  STANDBY 
CAPACITY RESERVATION PAYMENT 
 
The Generation and Transmission Standby Capacity Reservation Fee Payment 
shall be determined by multiplying the Contract Standby Capacity times the Generation 
and Transmission Standby Capacity Reservation Fee. 
 
DETERMINATION OF DAILY USAGE DEMAND 
For  billing  purposes,  the  Customer s  billing  demand  for  the  Daily  Usage 
 
 
Demand  Charge  will  be  determined  separately  from  and  will  have  no  effect  on  the 
billing demand determined under Schedule SG, Schedule PG, or Schedule TG that this 
tariff complements.  The Daily Usage Billing Demand shall be the maximum fifteen 
(15) minute integrated demand portion of the daily load that is normally supplied by the 
Customer s generation and covered by the Contract Standby Capacity that is actually 
supplied  by  the  Company.  In  other  words,  the  Daily  Usage  Billing  Demand  as 
described  above  is  based  on  the  lesser  of  a)  (Contract  Standby  Capacity  minus  RE 
system output), or b) Customer s peak measured demand for power purchased from the 
Company.  After the Annual Grace Energy has been exhausted, all such usage shall be 
billed as Daily Usage Billing Demand.

Standby Hours....................... ........................................................... 
 
Customer will be allowed each Year beginning January 1st, an Annual Grace 
 
Energy  amount  equal  to  the  Standby  Hours  times  the  Contract  Standby  Capacity 
without  incurring  a  Daily  Usage  Demand  Charge.    Energy  consumption  due  to 
Customer  use  of  Standby  Service  during  a  Company  Non-Dispatch  Period  shall  not 
count against the amount of Annual Grace Energy.  A Company Non-Dispatch Period 
is defined as the full or partial generation outage time of a Customer who is subject to a 
Power Purchase Agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company or its 
system  operator  has  dispatch  authority  over  the  Customer s  facilities  and  the 
Customer s facilities have not been dispatched by the Company or its system operator.  
Fluctuations in RE system output of up to twenty percent (20%) of Contract Standby 
Capacity  that  occur  outside  of  the  hours  of  noon  to  8  p.m.  Mountain  Time  on  non-
Holiday weekdays will not count against the amount of Annual Grace Energy. 
 
After the Annual Grace Energy has been exhausted and Customer uses Standby 
Service, the Customer shall pay the Daily Usage Demand Charge.  In a billing Month, 
when Customer uses Standby Service, the Schedule SG, Schedule PG, or Schedule TG 
Billing Demand and the Daily Usage Billing Demand will be determined separately.  
The Schedule SG, Schedule PG, or Schedule TG Billing Demand will be the maximum 
fifteen (15)  minute integrated  Kilowatt Demand  determined  after separating  Standby 
Service usage from the total metered demands.  The date and time within each Billing 
Month of the Schedule SG, Schedule PG, or Schedule TG Measured Demand may or 
may not be at the same date and time as the Standby Daily Usage Measured Demand.  
Standby Daily Usage Billing Demand will be in addition to the Billed Demand charges 
under the Schedule SG, Schedule PG, or Schedule TG as previously described.

METER INSTALLATION 
RECYLED ENERGY SERVICE 
SCHEDULE RE 
The  Company  shall  install,  own,  operate,  and  maintain,  the  metering  to 
measure  the  electric  power  and  energy  supplied  to  Customer  to  allow  for  proper 
billing  of  the  separate  Schedule  SG  Service,  Schedule  PG Service  or Schedule  TG 
Service  and  Standby  Service  demands  and  Grace  Period  identified  above.    In 
particular,  the  Company  will  install  a  meter  that  measures  the  flow  of  power  and 
energy  from  the  Customer s  own  generating  facility  (Production  Metering).    The 
Customer shall pay the Monthly Production Meter Charge under this schedule. 
As  a  result  of  the  electrical  or  physical  configuration  of  the  Customer s 
generation  facility,  the  Company  may  determine  that  it  is  more  practical  or 
economical to use Production Metering installed and owned by the Customer, rather 
than  installing  Company-owned  metering  equipment.    If  the  Company,  at  its  sole 
discretion,  makes  such  a  determination,  then  the  Customer-owned  Production 
Metering may be used for billing purposes, so long as such metering equipment meets 
the Company s standards for quality and accuracy. 
If  through  the  course  of  the  Company s  evaluation  of  the  metering 
requirements  for  the  Production  Meter(s),  the  Company  determines,  at  its  sole 
discretion, that it is impracticable, uneconomical or unnecessary to install metering on 
the  Customer s  generator(s),  the  Company  shall  determine  the  billing  for  the 
provision of the Standby Service tariff on an un-metered and calculated basis.  This 
determination can only be made if the only electrical load located at the Customer s 
site  is  station  power  equipment  as  defined  by  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory 
Commission (FERC). 
Regardless  of  the  Company s  ultimate  determination  of  the  requirement  (or 
lack thereof) for installation of Production Metering, a meter will always be required 
at  the  Point  of  Delivery  between  the  Company  and  Customer  and  such  meter  will 
measure both delivered and received capacity and energy.

DEFINITIONS 
 
Baseline Load 
Baseline  Load  is  an  estimate of the participating Customer s load if a 
Curtailment Event had not been called.  The Baseline Load for any fifteen (15) 
minute  interval  during  an  event  will  be  calculated  as  the  average  of  the 
measured Demand during the same interval of the Customer s five (5) highest 
energy  consumption  days  within  the  last  ten  (10)  non-Holiday,  non-weekend, 
non-event days.  Baseline Load calculations will be modified by a Baseline Load 
Adjustment to correct for substantive differences between baseline calculations 
and conditions on the day of an event. 
Baseline Load Adjustment 
An event day correction will be made to a participant s Baseline Load 
for each fifteen (15) minute interval during the event to reflect weather or other 
substantive differences between the Customer s load on the event day and the 
baseline calculation.  The Baseline Load Adjustment will be the average fifteen 
(15) minute Kilowatt (kW) difference between the baseline calculation and the 
Customer s  actual  load  during  the  two  (2)  hours  prior  to  Event  Notification.  
This  calculated difference will be added to the  Customer s Baseline Load for 
each  fifteen  (15)  minute  interval  within  the  Curtailment  Event  window.    The 
event day correction may either raise or lower the Customer s baseline load. 
Curtailment Event 
The Company may initiate a curtailment event either (1) when there is a 
capacity, contingency and/or economic constraint upon the electrical system, or 
(2) at the Company s discretion, for up to two (2) test events each calendar Year.  
Events may be called between the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.  Events 
 
will be no less than one (1) hour in duration and no more than four (4) hours in 
duration within this time period.  Customers will be subject to no more than one 
(1) event in any twenty-four (24) hour period.  No more than fifteen (15) events 
can be called for any one (1) Customer during a given year (sixty (60) total event 
hours).    Should  a  capacity  or  contingency  situation  arise  outside  of  the 
prescribed  hours  of  12:00  p.m.  to  8:00  p.m.,  program  participants  may  be 
notified and asked to curtail load on a  best effort  basis. The Customer will be 
under  no  obligation  to  reduce  load,  but  those  able  to  participate  will  be 
compensated for energy reductions at the Performance Incentive level.

Energy Reduction 
Energy  Reduction  during  a  Curtailment  Event,  as  measured  in 
Kilowatt-Hour (kWh), will be calculated by subtracting the Customer s actual 
usage during the event period from the Customer s usage under their Baseline 
Load  for  the  same  time  period.    This  calculation  will  be  done  after  any 
Baseline Load Adjustment has been made. 
Event Notification 
Participating  Customers  will  receive  advance  notice  of  curtailment 
events.  Notifications will be delivered a minimum of one (1) hour prior to an 
event and will include the event start time, duration of event, and event end 
time.    Notifications  will  be  sent  to  the  participating  Customer s  designated 
contact(s) via e-mail, text, voice message, or combination thereof as specified 
by the Customer.  Customers are responsible for insuring contact information 
is  kept  current  and  notifying  the  Program  Manager  if  any  changes  are 
necessary. 
Load Reduction 
Load  Reduction  is  a  calculation  of  the  effective  amount  of  load,  in 
Kilowatt (kW), that a Customer was able to curtail during a curtailment event.  
The load reduction is calculated by subtracting the Customer s actual usage, in 
Kilowatt-Hour  (kWh),  during  an  event  from  the  Customer s  baseline  usage 
during the same time period, and dividing by the number of hours within the 
Curtailment Event. 
Load Reduction Obligation 
A Customer s Load Reduction Obligation is the load a Customer under 
this schedule agrees to curtail during a Curtailment Event. Each participating 
Customer will be responsible for reducing their facilities load during an event 
by  an  amount  equal  to  or  greater  than  that  designated  within  their  contract.  
Customers will designate their load reduction obligations, in terms of Kilowatt 
(kW),  by  calendar  Month.    The  Kilowatt  (kW)  commitment  can  vary  each 
Month  and  may  be  a  zero  Kilowatt  (kW)  commitment,  however  during  the 
 
summer  Months  of  June  through  September  the  Customers  commitment 
cannot  be  less  than  twenty-five  Kilowatts  (25  kW).    The  load  reduction 
obligation  must  be  achievable  by  a  Customer during non-Holiday weekdays 
between the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. 
During  the  portion  of  a  Curtailment  Event  which  falls  between  the

increased  to  each  Customer  receiving  service  within  a  municipality  wherein  the  Company  pays  an 
occupation tax by an appropriate percentage calculated to recover the amount of the tax. 
 
In  order  to  recover  from  all  Customers  within  the  municipality  the  amount  of  said  tax,  the 
Company will calculate an electric occupation tax percentage surcharge in the following manner: 
Estimated  local  electric  revenues  from  within  a  municipality  will  be  divided  by  the 
estimated  total  local  revenue  to  arrive  at  an  estimated  electric  percentage  of  total  local 
revenue. 
The estimated electric percentage of total revenue will be multiplied by the total amount of 
the  occupation  tax  levied  by  the  municipality  to  derive  the  amount  of  the  tax  to  be 
recovered through electric sales.  Any amount of the electric occupation tax from a prior 
period either over or under recovered will be added to or subtracted from the amount of tax 
to be recovered through current electric sales. 
The  amount  of  the  tax  to  be  recovered  through  electric  sales  will  be  divided  by  the 
estimated local electric revenue to derive an occupation tax percentage surcharge.

OCCUPATION TAX SURCHARGE 
 
In the event a municipality ceases to assess an occupation tax, and does not replace such tax with a 
tax of like character or effect, the Company will pay the municipality any amounts it may have recovered 
in excess of the appropriate assessment, calculated on a prorated basis.  If the Company has recovered less 
money than required to meet its tax obligation, it will continue to apply the percentage surcharge until the 
amount  sufficient  to  pay  the  municipal  assessment  has  been  recovered.    If,  however,  the  municipality 
enacts a tax, license or fee to replace an occupation tax; such as a franchise fee; the Company will carry 
over  any  amounts  which  are  over  or  under  recovered  at  the  time  the  old  tax  ceases  and  the  new  tax 
becomes effective, and will apply said over or under collections to the payment of the new assessment.

QUALITY OF SERVICE PLAN (QSP) 
 
APPLICABILITY 
 
All rate schedules except transmission rate schedules are subject to Quality of Service Plan (QSP) 
bill credit adjustments.  Under the plan, the following performance thresholds are established: 1) Customer 
Complaints received by the Commission; 2) Telephone Response Time by the Company s call centers; 
and  3)  Regional  Electric  Distribution  System  Reliability.    The  QSP  also  establishes  electric  service 
Continuity  and  Restoration  thresholds  to  measure  the  level  of  electric  service  delivered  to  individual 
Customers  residing  within  Operating  Regions  with  an  Outage  Management  System  (OMS).    If  the 
Company s performance falls below the established thresholds for the Performance Year, then the QSP 
specifies the consequences that follow from such performance, including additional reporting and payment 
of bill credits under certain circumstances. 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Performance Year 
Performance Year is a calendar Year.

Customer Average Interruption Duration Index 
The Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) is the average time to restore 
electric  service.    The  Annual  CAIDI  shall  be  calculated  by  dividing  the  total  duration  of  all 
Customer sustained (greater than five (5) minutes) interruptions by the total number of Customer 
sustained interruptions during the Performance Year. 
System Average Interruption Duration Index 
The  System  Average  Interruption  Duration  Index  (SAIDI)  is  the  average  interruption 
duration for all Customers served.  The Annual SAIDI shall be calculated by dividing the total 
duration  of  all  Customer  sustained  interruptions  by  the  average  number  of  Customers  served 
during the Performance Year. 
System Average Interruption Frequency Index 
The  System  Average  Interruption  Frequency  Index  (SAIFI)  is  the  average  number  of 
interruptions per Customer served.  The Annual SAIFI shall be calculated by dividing the total 
number of Customer sustained interruptions by the average number of Customers served during 
the Performance Year. 
Answer Time 
Answer Time shall be measured from the instant the Customer selects the option from the 
mechanized menu to speak to a Customer Service Representative (CSR) to the time the call is 
responded to by a CSR. 
 
 
 
The QSP shall be in effect for Performance Years 2020, and 2021.

The  maximum  $7.064  million  bill  credit  associated  with  Regional  System  Reliability  shall  be 
 
allocated  to  each  of  the  Operating  Regions.    The  bill  credit  amount  at  risk  for  each  of  the  non-OMS 
 
Operating  Regions  shall  be  set  equal  to  $7.50  times  the  number  of  Customers  in  that  region  as  of 
 
December 31 of the Performance Year.  The total of the bill credit amounts at risk for all of the non-OMS 
 
Operating Regions shall be subtracted from $7.064 million, and the balance shall be allocated as the bill 
 
credit amounts at risk for each of the OMS Operating Regions pro-rata based on the on the number of 
 
Customers in each region as of December 31 of the Performance Year. 
 
 
 
BILL CREDIT DISBURSEMENT 
 
Any bill credits shall be applied to electric Customer bills during the following July billing cycle of 
 
 
a given Performance Year.  Any bill credit amounts not remitted by the end of the July billing cycle shall 
 
accrue interest beginning after the September billing cycle of the applicable Year at a rate equal to the

If the Rate of Customer Complaints per 1,000 Customers exceeds 0.8, then a bill credit 
shall be paid as set forth in the Bill Credit Adjustment section herein. 
Calculation 
Rate of Customer Complaints per 1,000 Customers = Total Customer Complaints divided 
by the number of December bills times 1,000. 
Exclusions 
The total number of Customer Complaints shall be recorded with no exclusions, but the 
Company may request exclusion of certain circumstances or events.  Such events include, but are 
not limited to, periods of emergency, catastrophe, natural disaster, catastrophic storm, civil unrest, 
or  other  events  affecting  large  numbers  of  Customers.    Such  events  should  include  only  those 
extraordinary events that result in an unusually high number of complaints.  Nuisance complaints, 
for example those generated by disgruntled employees or others aimed at increasing the complaint 
volume to the Commission may be considered for exclusion. 
Telephone Response Time 
On a Performance Year basis, this measure shall assess the response time to Customer calls 
answered  by  the  Company s  call  centers.    The  Company  shall  calculate  the  percent  of  calls 
answered  within  forty-five  (45)  seconds  using  an  automatic  call  distributor  (ACD).    The 
benchmark is seventy percent (70%) of phone calls answered within forty-five (45) seconds. 
Performance Threshold   Bill Credit 
If the percentage of telephone calls answered within forty-five (45)  seconds is less than 
seventy percent (70%), then a bill credit shall be paid as set forth in the Bill Credit Adjustment 
section herein.

Calculation 
At  the  end  of  the  Performance  Year,  the  Monthly  Answer  Time  as  measured  by  the 
Company s  ACD  shall  be  averaged  over  the  twelve  (12)  Month  period  to  produce  an  annual 
average telephone response percent less than or equal to forty-five (45) seconds.   
 
Exclusions 
Telephone  response  time  shall  be  recorded  with  no  exclusions,  but  the  Company  may 
request exclusion of certain circumstances or events.  Such events include, but are not limited to, 
periods of emergency, catastrophe, natural disaster, catastrophic storm, civil unrest, or other events 
affecting large numbers of Customers.  Such events should include only those extraordinary events 
that result in an unusually heavy influx of telephone calls to the Company s call centers.  Nuisance 
calls, for example those generated by disgruntled employees or others aimed at increasing the call 
volume to the Company s call centers may be considered for exclusion. 
 
Regional Electric Distribution System Reliability 
The Company shall strive to maintain the reliability of electric service in each Operating 
Region  so  that  the  annual  SAIDI  for  Ordinary  Distribution  Interruptions  (SAIDI-ODI)  in  each 
Performance Year does not exceed the established Reliability Warning Threshold (RWT) for that 
region.  If SAIDI-ODI exceeds the Reliability Warning Threshold for an Operating Region for two 
(2) consecutive Years, each Customer within that region shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata share 
of the regional reliability bill credit. 
 
Classification of Electric Service Interruptions 
Interruptions shall be classified hierarchically by (1) duration, (2) origin, (3) Major Event 
Day,  and  (4)  event  circumstance  criteria.    The  SAIDI,  SAIFI,  and  CAIDI  shall  be  calculated 
separately  for  each  classification  of  interruptions  and  for  each  electric  Operating  Region.    For 
annual calculations, the regional average annual Customer count shall be the average of the twelve 
(12) Month-end Customer counts for the calendar Year. 
The  primary  measure  of  system  average  reliability  performance  shall  be  the  SAIDI  for 
Ordinary Distribution Interruptions (SAIDI-ODI).

service can be restored. 
For each SESI, the number of Customers experiencing a sustained Customer Interruption

shall include the effects of stepped service restoration.  SESI are divided into three (3) classes of 
interruptions based on event origin: 
(1) 
(2) 
Bulk Supply Interruptions (BULKI) shall include SESI that originate at an electric 
power generation facility, or on the electric power transmission system (including 
transmission  substations  and  including  the  transmission  portions  of  substations 
providing distribution service), or on the electric power facilities of other electric 
power utilities.  BULKI shall also include those SESI in which more than half of 
the  total  time  of  electric  service  unavailability  is  due  to  a  controlled  load 
curtailment initiated by the Company to protect the bulk power supply system. 
Substation  Interruptions  (SUBI)  shall  include  SESI  that  originate  in  the  non-
transmission portions within an electric distribution substation or the distribution-
serving portions of a combined transmission and distribution-serving substation of 
the Company. SUBI specifically include interruptions that originate in a substation 
distribution  power  transformer  (including  its  associated  non-transmission  system 
high-side protective equipment) or on the Primary Voltage

DEFINITIONS   Cont d 
 
The over-recovery or under-recovery of RDA amounts from two (2) Years previous.  In 
2020 and 2021 the RDA True-up value shall be $0.  The RDA True-up consists of the difference 
between: the revenues the RDA Rate was designed to recover or Lost Fixed Cost Recovery (LFCR) 
from two (2) Years prior; and the actual revenue dollars collected under the RDA Rate from two 
(2) Years prior.  Two separate RDA True-ups will be calculated for: (1) Schedule R, Pilot Schedule 
RD-TDR, Schedule RE-TOU, and Schedule R-OO; and (2) Schedule C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT (DSM) DISINCENTIVE OFFSET 
 
The  Commission  approved  disincentive  offset  amounts  for  residential  and  small  commercial

Where: 
 
 
A = Cap Cost Recovery Base Winter Season/Summer Season Tier 1/Off-Peak 
B = Cap Cost Recovery Current Winter Season/Summer Season Tier 1/Off-Peak 
C = Cap Cost Recovery Base Summer Season Tier 2/On-Peak and Shoulder 
D = Cap Cost Recovery Current Summer Season Tier 2 /On-Peak and Shoulder 
 
RE-TOU Trial Lost Fixed Cost Recovery (RE-TOU-LFCR) 
Lost Fixed Cost Recovery for Trial Schedule RE-TOU is calculated as follows:  
RE-TOU-LFCR = (A x B) + (C x D) - E 
Where: 
A = Total sales Winter Season and Summer Season sales under 500 kWh per Month to 
RE-TOU Trial Customers 
B = Residential (R) Winter Season & Summer Season Tier 1 Rate 
C = Total Summer Season sales over 500 kWh per Month to 
RE-TOU Trial Customers

APPLICABILITY 
 
All  rate  schedules  for  electric  service  are  subject  to  a  Demand-Side  Management  Cost 
 
 
Adjustment (DSMCA) designed to recover the costs of Commission-approved energy efficiency, load 
 
management,  SmartGridCity  Pricing  Pilot  Programs  and  Interruptible  Service  Option  Credit  (ISOC) 
 
programs.   
 
 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
 
 
 
The  DTB  is  the  difference  between  DSMCA  revenues  collected  and  the  actual  costs 
 
incurred. The DTB shall include a credit on any over-recovered balance equal to the interest 
 
accrued Monthly at the Customer deposit rate. 
 
 
 
The  CDSC  are  equal  to  the  projected  calendar  Year  expenditures  for  the  Company s 
 
DSM Portfolio after January 1, 2009.  These costs, less whatever portion of such costs that are 
 
being  recovered  in  base  rates,  shall  be  expensed  and  recovered  over  twelve  (12)  Months 
 
beginning January 1 of the Year in which the costs are expected to be incurred. 
 
 
 
The DSM Portfolio shall consist of the energy-efficiency and peak Demand reduction 
 
programs,  including  Saver s  Switch  but  excluding  the  ISOC  Program,  approved  by  the 
 
Commission as a result of the Company s biennial filing made every two (2) Years on July 1 or 
 
on such other date as the Commission may approve.  
 
 
 
The  DT  is  the  spreadsheet  tracker  where  all  DSMCA-related  expenditures  and  cost 
 
recovery will be recorded.  The DSM Tracker will be updated Monthly and filed annually with 
 
the Commission. 
 
 
Disincentive Offset (DO) 
 
Beginning with the 2015 DSM Plan, on July 1 of the Year following the previous plan 
 
 
Year,  the  Company  shall  be  entitled  to  recovery  over  twelve  (12)  Months  the  pre-tax 
 
Disincentive Offset of $5 million if DSM program performance meets or exceeds one hundred 
T 
percent (100%) of the Commission-approved electric energy savings goal.  
 
Beginning with the 2019 DSM Plan, on July 1 of the Year following the previous plan 
 
Year,  the  Company  shall  be  entitled  to  recovery  over  twelve  (12)  Months  the  pre-tax 
 
disincentive offset of $1.5 million if DSM programs achieve 400 GWh of energy savings and an 
additional $1.5 million if the Company achieves at least 500 GWh of energy savings that year. 
Beginning with the 2019 DSM Plan, the Disincentive Offset will be recovered only from 
the Commercial and Industrial Primary, Commercial and Industrial 
Secondary,  Commercial  and  Industrial  Transmission,  and  Lighting 
classes and will not be applied to Residential and Small Commercial 
(rate class C).

associated  with  revenues  that  would  have  been  collected  though  a  Revenue  Decoupling 
Adjustment.  If a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment becomes effective in 2019, the Residential 
and Small Commercial Disincentive Offset will be prorated to account for the implementation 
of the Revenue Decoupling Adjustment. 
 
Performance Incentive (PI) 
 Beginning with the 2015 DSM Plan, the Company shall be entitled to recover through 
the DSMCA on July 1 of the Year following the previous plan Year a performance incentive 
equal to five percent (5%) of net economic benefits for achievements at and above one-hundred 
percent  (100%)  of  the  Commission-approved  energy  savings  goal  for  that  Year.    No 
performance incentive shall accrue for savings below one-hundred percent (100%) of goal. 
Beginning with the 2019 DSM Plan, the Company shall be entitled to recover through 
the DSMCA on July 1 of the Year following the previous plan Year a performance incentive 
equal  to  40  percent  of  incremental  net  economic  benefits,  above  280  GWh,  beginning  at  80 
percent of the 500 GWh goal and up to 550 GWh of savings.    
Beginning with the 2012 DSM Plan, there will be a $30 million cap on the combination

TRANSMISSION COST ADJUSTMENT 
 
APPLICABILITY 
 
All rate schedules for electric service are subject to a Transmission Cost Adjustment (TCA) to 
reflect  the  ongoing  capital  costs  associated  with  transmission  investment  that  are  not  being  recovered 
through the Company s base rates.  The TCA amount will be subject to annual changes to be effective on 
January 1 of each Year. 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Over/Under Recovery Amount 
The Over/Under Recovery Amount is the balance, positive or negative, of TCA revenues 
received less the Transmission Cost intended to be recovered each Year through the TCA. 
True-Up Amount 
The  True-Up  Amount  is  equal  to  the  difference,  positive  or  negative,  between  the 
Transmission  Cost,  calculated  based  on  the  projected  net  transmission  plant  and  transmission 
construction work in progress (CWIP) balances, and the Transmission Cost calculated based on 
the actual net transmission plant and transmission CWIP balances. 
If any projects included in the Year-end CWIP balance were placed in service sometime 
during the subsequent Year when the TCA was effective, then the CWIP balance will be reduced 
accordingly.  Specifically, the component of the Year-end CWIP balance attributable to any such 
project will be reduced by the following: 
Year-End Project CWIP Balance X (Number of Months Project Was in Service During 
Subsequent Year / 13) 
Transmission Cost 
For the purpose of this tariff, the Transmission Cost is defined as (1) a return, equal to the 
Company s weighted average cost of capital, on the projected increase in the retail jurisdictional 
portion of the thirteen (13) Month average net transmission plant for the Year in which the TCA 
will  be  in  effect;  (2)  the  plant-related  ownership  costs  associated  with  such  incremental 
transmission investment, including depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, income taxes 
and  pre-funded  AFUDC,  and  (3)  a  return,  equal  to  the  Company s  weighted  average  cost  of 
capital,  on  the  projected  Year-end  transmission  CWIP  balance  as  of  December  31  of  the  Year 
immediately preceding the effective date of the TCA.

If any projects included in the Year-end CWIP balance are projected to be placed in service 
sometime during the subsequent Year when the TCA will be effective, then the CWIP balance will 
be reduced accordingly.  Specifically, the component of the Year-end CWIP balance attributable to 
any such project will be reduced by the following: 
Year-End Project CWIP Balance X (Number of Months Project Will Be in Service During 
Subsequent Year / 13) 
Transmission Cost Adjustment 
The Transmission Cost Adjustment is equal to the Transmission Cost, plus, beginning with 
the second Year of the TCA, the True-Up Amount and, beginning with the third Year of the TCA, 
the Over/Under Recovery Amount, charged on a dollar per Kilowatt basis for rate schedules with 
Demand rates and on a dollar per Kilowatt-Hour basis for rate schedules without Demand rates. 
However,  Customers  on  Schedule  RE-TOU  and  R-OO  shall  be  billed  the  Transmission  Cost 
Adjustment on a percentage basis applicable to base energy charges.   
 
INFORMATION TO BE FILED WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION 
 
Each proposed revision in the Transmission Cost Adjustment will be accomplished by filing an 
advice letter on November 1 of each Year to take effect on the next January 1 and will be accompanied by 
supporting data and information as set forth in Ordering Paragraph No. 6 of Decision No. C07-1085. 
 
TCA ADJUSTMENT WITH CHANGES IN BASE RATES   
 
Whenever  the  Company  implements  changes  in  base  rates  as  the  result  of  a  final  order  in  an 
electric  Phase  I  rate  case,  it  shall  simultaneously  adjust  the  TCA  to  remove  all  costs  that  have  been 
included in base rates. 
 
INTEREST CALCULATION UNDER A TRUE UP 
 
Over collections of TCA revenues that are due to over projections of net plant and CWIP balances 
shall be assessed interest as part of the true-up mechanism in the TCA.  To determine an over collection of 
TCA revenues due to over projections of net plant and CWIP, the revenue requirements associated with 
the projected net plant in service and CWIP shall be compared to the revenue requirements associated 
with the actual net plant in service and CWIP for that same Year.  Interest is only assessed on the positive 
balance of TCA revenues calculated on projected plant in service and CWIP compared to the calculated 
TCA revenues based on actual plant in service and CWIP over the same time period.  Interest shall be 
calculated at the after tax weighted average cost of capital.

APPLICABILITY 
 
 
All rate schedules for electric service are subject to an Electric Commodity Adjustment (ECA) 
 
to reflect the cost of energy utilized to supply electric service.  The ECA Factors for all applicable rate 
 
schedules will be applied to all Kilowatt-Hours sold by the Company with the exception of any buy-
 
through  Kilowatt-Hours  (BT  kWh)  sold  to  participants  in  the  Interruptible  Service  Option  Credit 
 
(ISOC) program who buy through an economic interruption.  The ECA Factors for lighting service bills 
 
and  other  non-metered  service  will  be  determined  by  applying  the  ECA  Factor  to  the  calculated 
 
Monthly Kilowatt-Hour consumption. 
 
 
 
TIME-OF-USE ECA FACTORS APPLICABILITY 
 
All  Kilowatt-Hours  used  under  any  Rate  Schedule  for  Residential  Energy  Time  of  Use, 
 
 
Residential  Demand-Time  Differentiated  Rates,  Commercial  and  Industrial  Primary,  Transmission, 
N 
Special Contract Service, or Schedule EDR Customers shall be billed under the appropriate Time-of-
 
Use (TOU) ECA Factor.  Customers that receive electric service under any Commercial and Industrial 
 
Secondary Service Rate Schedule that have Measured Demands of one hundred Kilowatt (100 kW) or 
 
more  for  twelve  (12)  consecutive  Months  may  elect  to  be  billed  prospectively  under  the  Secondary 
 
TOU ECA Factor.  Subsequent to a Customer s election to be billed under the Secondary TOU ECA 
 
Factor, Customer must have a Measured Demand of one hundred Kilowatts (100 kW) or more every 
 
Month, except a Customer may have one (1) Month within the previous twelve (12) Months where the 
 
Customer Demand is less than one hundred Kilowatts (100 kW).  In the event that a second Month 
 
occurs  in  any  twelve  (12)  Month  period  where  the  Customer s  Measured  Demand  is  less  than  one 
 
hundred Kilowatts (100 kW), the Company shall bill the Customer under the non-TOU ECA Factor. 
 
 
The On-peak hours shall be 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. for all non-Holiday weekdays. The Off-peak 
 
period shall be all other hours.  The Residential TOU On-peak hours shall be 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. for 
 
all days, including Holidays and weekends.  The Off-peak period shall be all other hours.  The On-peak 
 
and Off-peak price differentials are based on the ratio of system marginal costs for a calendar Year.  
 
The On-peak and Off-peak price ratio will be projected annually and will be filed with the Commission 
 
on the first business day of November, and shall remain in effect for the subsequent calendar Year.  The 
 
TOU ECA rates will be updated with the Quarterly ECA rates and will be determined by applying the 
N 
fixed annual On-peak and Off-peak ratios to the quarterly ECA cost of service.  The On-Peak and Off-
N 
Peak rates for Schedule EDR will be determined separately on a quarterly basis.

TIME-OF-USE NOTICE AND METERING REQUIREMENTS 
 
Customers receiving service under the TOU ECA must have their usage metered by an Interval 
Data Recorder (IDR) meter.  If a requesting Customer is not currently metered with an IDR meter, the 
Company will install an IDR meter as soon as reasonably practicable and the Customer will be eligible 
for the TOU rate beginning with the first billing cycle immediately subsequent to the installation of the 
IDR meter. 
 
ELECTRIC COMMODITY ADJUSTMENT QUARTERLY FILING 
 
The Company shall file each quarter, on not less than fifteen (15) days  notice, an application to 
be effective on the first day of the Month of the next calendar quarter.  The Company may also file for 
more frequent changes to the ECA factors, subject to Commission approval. 
 
ELECTRIC COMMODITY ADJUSTMENT 
 
The ECA shall be calculated quarterly with the new ECA Factors to be effective on a prorated 
basis on the first day of the quarter.  The ECA Factors shall be determined by dividing the Quarterly 
ECA Revenue Requirement by the projected Kilowatt-Hour sales to which the ECA is applicable for 
the next calendar quarter. The ECA Factors shall be differentiated by service delivery voltage to reflect 
line losses.  A separate ECA factor, the Economic Development Rate ECA Factor, will be calculated 
for service under Schedule EDR based on the estimated marginal cost of energy, to recover incremental 
regulatory and legal costs incurred for the adoption and implementation of Schedule EDR as approved 
by the Commission, and to recover bad debt associated with service under Schedule EDR as approved 
by the Commission.

Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act (CACJA) 
House Bill HB10-1365 required Public Service to work with the Colorado Department of 
Public  Health  and  Environment  to  submit  a  plan  to  the  Commission  to  reduce  nitrogen  oxide 
emissions  at  Front  Range  coal  plants  by  seventy  percent  (70%)  to  eighty  percent  (80%)  by 
December 31, 2017.  The plan, which was approved by the Commission in 2010, includes  the 
retirement of five (5) aging coal plants, their replacement with a new natural gas combined cycle 
plant, the addition of pollution control equipment at three (3) other coal plants, and the conversion 
of one (1) coal plant to a natural gas fuel source. 
Eligible CACJA Projects 
The approved projects included in this CACJA Rider are as follows: 
1. 
Cherokee  5,  6,  and  7  --  a  natural  gas  combined  cycle  (CC)  plant,  including 
interconnection equipment. 
Pawnee selective catalytic reduction and particulate scrubber. 
Hayden 1 selective catalytic reduction. 
Hayden 2 selective catalytic reduction. 
2.

4. 
Eligibility  Window:  To  be  eligible  to  be  included  in  the  CACJA  Rider  a  cost  must  be 
incurred and associated with an investment that went into service between August 1, 2014 and 
December 31, 2017. 
CACJA Rider Revenue Requirement 
The  forecasted  or  actual  costs  associated  with  Eligible  CACJA  Projects,  including  the 
following: 
1. 
Variable non-fuel O&M expenses, including chemical and water expenses.  The 
2015 CACJA Base Costs will include the variable non-fuel O&M for the existing 
Cherokee  3  coal  unit.    After  that  unit  is  retired  at  the  end  of  2015,  subsequent 
CACJA Rider calculations will reflect the variable O&M savings from Cherokee 
3 s retirement.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 
The costs of debt and common equity weighted by the relative proportions of each in the 
Company s balance sheet.  For the purpose of developing the FRR, a forecast of the debt cost 
and capital structure for the following calendar Year will be used.  For the purpose of developing 
both the FRR and ARR, the return on equity shall be the latest return on equity approved by the 
Commission for the Company s electric department. 
 
 
CACJA Rider True-up 
The over-recovery or under-recovery of CACJA costs from two (2) Years previous.  In 
2015 and 2016 the CACJA Rider True-up value shall be $0. The CACJA Rider True-up consists 
of three  (3) components. The first is an adjustment that reconciles the difference between the 
FRR  and  the  prudently  incurred  ARR  from two (2) Years prior that are demonstrably tied to 
specific CACJA projects for which the Company has a Certificate of Public Convenience and 
Necessity (CPCN).  The second component accounts for the difference between the revenues the 
rider  was  designed  to  recover  from  Customers  and  the  actual  dollars  collected.    The  third 
component is an adjustment for interest expenses on the Monthly over- or under-recovery from 
two  (2)  Years  prior.    For  each  Month,  the  interest  component  shall  be  the  after-tax  WACC 
applied to the Monthly over- or under-collection from the mid-point of the Month to the date on 
which the Company will begin crediting or collecting the over- or under-collection through the 
CACJA Rider True-up. 
 
CLEAN AIR-CLEAN JOBS ACT RIDER AMOUNT 
The CACJA Rider Amount shall consist of the current Year s FRR plus the CACJA Rider True-
The following formula is used to determine the total annual costs to be collected through the

factors will be updated based on a projection of Energy use by Customer class for the forecast Year.  Rates 
 
shall be designed by dividing the costs allocated to each class by the projected class billing determinants.  
 
The  rates  for  all  Years  will  be  based  on  twelve  (12)  Months  of  projected  class  billing  determinants.   
 
Customers  shall  be  billed  the  CACJA  Rider  on  a  dollar  per  Kilowatt  basis  for  tariff  schedules  with 
 
Demand  rates  and  on  a  dollar  per  Kilowatt-Hour  basis  for  tariff  schedules  without  Demand  rates.

FLEXIBLE PRICING POLICY 
 
 
The following rules and regulations set forth the Company s policy regarding the development of 
flexibly  priced  electric  service  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of   40-3-104.3,  C.R.S.,  and  the  
Commission Rules found at 4 CCR 723-10. 
 
APPLICABILITY 
 
This policy shall be applicable to any Residential, Commercial or Industrial electric Customer or 
potential Customer of the Company to whom the Company offers a contract with flexible pricing.  The 
Company shall retain complete discretion as to which Customers or potential Customers shall be offered 
flexible pricing. 
 
REQUIREMENTS FOR FLEXIBLE PRICING 
 
electric service Customer, the following facts must first be demonstrated by the Company: 
In order for flexible pricing to be considered for a specific electric service Customer or potential 
1. 
The price of any such service is not below the variable cost of providing that service.  The 
variable  cost  of  the  Company  will  be  based  on  the  average  of  production  costs  of  the 
Company and purchased energy costs for Company load for the most recent twelve (12) 
Months ending December 31, expressed in dollars per net Megawatt-Hour.  The variable 
cost will be the quotient of the sum of purchased energy costs, fuel, fuel handling and the 
percentage of production operation and maintenance costs determined to be variable in the 
Company s most recent general rate proceeding divided by the sum of net generation of the 
Company s thermal units and energy purchased for Company load.  If the discounted price 
is below the applicable tariff energy rate, the Company will maintain separate accounting 
records for those sales and will remove these sales and associated costs from the Electric 
Commodity Adjustment calculation. 
The Customer, or potential Customer, has expressed its intention to decline or discontinue, 
or partially discontinue service, to provide its own service, or to pursue the purchase of 
alternate services from another provider. 
The approval of the flexibly priced rate will not adversely affect the remaining Customers 
of the Company.  Accounting records will be maintained and available for the inspection of 
the  Staff  of  the  Commission  and  the  Office  of  Consumer  Counsel,  indicating  the 
disposition of all costs associated with each flexibly priced contract and the conformance 
of this policy to the requirements of  40-3-104.3(2)(a) C.R.S. 
The approval of the flexibly priced rate is in the public interest.

TEP  Class  Cost  Allocations:    The  Company  will  assign  class  responsibilities  for  the  TEP 
Revenue Requirement as approved by the Commission in respective Transportation Electrification Plan 
proceedings. 
 
TEP REVENUE REQUIREMENT 
The TEP revenue requirement ( TEPRR ) is defined as (1) a return, equal to the Company s 
weighted average cost of capital, on the Transportation Electrification Plan capital and rebates; (2) the 
plant-related  ownership  costs  associated  with  such  investment,  including  depreciation  expense, 
accumulated deferred income taxes, income tax expense, and the amortization expense of the rebates; 
(3) operations and maintenance expenses associated with the Transportation Electrification Plan; and 
(4) energy costs to operate Company-owned public charging stations incurred in connection with the 
Commission-approved TEP for the Year in which the  TEPA will be in effect, decreased by (1) the 
revenues  from  monthly  service  charges  for  Charger  Service  received  under  Schedule  EVC;  and  (2) 
revenues from Company-owned public charging stations received under Schedule EVC in connection 
with the Commission-approved Transportation Electrification Plan for the Year in which the TEPA 
will be in effect. 
 
RATE DESIGN  
Rates  shall  be  designed  by  dividing  the  costs  allocated  to  each  class  by  the  projected  class 
billing  determinants.    Customers  shall  be  billed  the  TEPA  on  a  dollar  per  Kilowatt  basis  for  tariff 
schedules  with  Demand  rates  and  on  a  dollar  per  Kilowatt-Hour  basis  for  tariff  schedules  without 
Demand rates. However, Customers on Schedules RE-TOU and R-OO shall be billed the TEPA on a 
percentage basis applicable to base energy charges. 
 
SEMI-ANNUAL FILINGS 
On October 1st of each Year, the Company shall file for approval to update the TEPA rates based 
 
on  forecasted  TEP  revenue  requirement  for  the  following  calendar  year,  and  True-up  Amount  and 
Over/Under Recovery Amount for the most recently completed calendar year. The updated rate will be 
in effect for the following calendar year.  
On  April  1st  of  each  year  the  Company  shall  file  a  report  detailing  TEPA  expenditures  and 
 
revenues  from  the  preceding  year.  This  filing  will  establish  the  True-up  and  Over/Under  Recovery 
Amounts that will be included in the October 1st TEPA rate update.  
Both the October 1st filing and the April 1st filing will include additional information on TEP 
programs.

ELECTRIC RATES 
 
RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD ADJUSTMENT (RESA) 
 
The charge for electric service calculated under Company s total electric rates shall be increased by 
one  percent  (1.00%).    Said  adjustment  shall  apply  to  all  charges  for  electric  service  including  base 
Monthly  Rates  under  the  applicable  Rate  Schedule,  Base  Rate  Adjustments  and  Non-Base  Rate 
Adjustments.  The funds shall be tracked in a segregated account specifically designated for meeting the 
requirements of the Renewable Energy Standard Rules. 
 
In  addition  to  the  RESA  charges  above,  for  Customers  that  receive  optional  service  under 
Schedule PV and elect Net Metering under Schedule NM who install their generation facilities on or after 
December 26, 2014, an additional RESA Monthly bill amount shall be charged as follows: the additional 
RESA charge shall be based on the total energy in Kilowatt-Hours produced by the Customer s generation 
system as measured by the Production Meter during the Billing Month.  The additional RESA charge shall 
be calculated by multiplying the Monthly Kilowatt-Hour production as measured by the Production Meter 
on the Customer s production times the total effective Monthly applicable energy rate on a per Kilowatt-
Hour basis including the applicable electric service rate schedule base Energy Charge and all applicable 
Base Rate Adjustments and Non-Base Rate Adjustments.  The resulting product will be multiplied by one 
percent (1.00%) to determine the Customer s additional RESA Monthly bill amount. 
All  Customers  receiving  compensation  for  excess  Kilowatt-Hour  credits,  per  Commission 
Renewable Energy Standard Rules applicable to Net Metering shall also receive additional credit for any 
RESA accorded to the compensated excess accrued credits.  
The RESA funds as paid by Customers as set forth herein shall be tracked by the Company in a 
segregated  account  specifically  designated  for  meeting  the  Company s  requirements  as  set  forth  in  the 
Commission s Renewable Energy Standard Rules.  The RESA shall expire on December 31, 2022.

Colorado Energy Plan Adjustment (CEPA) 
 
The charge for electric service calculated under Company s total electric rates shall be increased by 
one percent (1.00%) to recover the regulatory asset to collect the incremental depreciation costs associated 
with the early retirements of Comanche 1 and Comanche 2 in accordance with the Preferred Colorado 
Energy Plan Portfolio (CEPP) approved by the Commission in Decision No. C18-0761 in Proceeding No. 
16A-0396E  (Electric  Resource  Plan  Proceeding)  and  Decision  No.  C18-0762  in  Proceeding  No.  17A-
0797E  (Accelerated  Depreciation  Renewable  Energy  Standard  Adjustment  (RESA)  Reduction 
Proceeding).    Public  Service  is  allowed  to  earn  a  return  on  this  regulatory  asset  at  the  Company s 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).   
Said adjustment shall apply to all charges for electric service including base Monthly Rates under 
the applicable Rate Schedule, Base Rate Adjustments and Non-Base Rate Adjustments.   
In  addition  to  the  CEPA  charges  above,  for  Customers  that  receive  optional  service  under 
Schedule PV and elect Net Metering under Schedule NM who install their generation facilities on or after 
December 26, 2014, an additional CEPA Monthly bill amount shall be charged as follows: the additional 
CEPA charge shall be based on the total energy in Kilowatt-Hours produced by the Customer s generation 
system as measured by the Production Meter during the Billing Month.  The additional CEPA charge shall 
be calculated by multiplying the Monthly Kilowatt-Hour production as measured by the Production Meter 
on the Customer s production times the total effective Monthly applicable energy rate on a per Kilowatt-
Hour basis including the applicable electric service rate schedule base Energy Charge and all applicable 
Base Rate Adjustments and Non-Base Rate Adjustments.  The resulting product will be multiplied by one 
percent (1.00%) to determine the Customer s additional CEPA Monthly bill amount. 
For the period that the CEPA is in effect, Public Service shall file annual reports no later than 
All  Customers  receiving  compensation  for  excess  Kilowatt-Hour  credits,  per  Commission 
Renewable Energy Standard Rules applicable to Net Metering shall also receive additional credit for any 
CEPA accorded to the compensated excess accrued credits.

BENEFIT OF SERVICE 
 
An  application  for  electric  service  may  be  made  via  telephone  or  electronically  through  the 
Company s  website.  The  Company  may  require  any  applicant  to  sign  an  Application  Contract  before 
service is supplied.  However, the use of electric service constitutes an agreement under which the user 
receives electric service and agrees to pay the Company therefore in accordance with the applicable rate 
schedules, Rules and Regulations.  Each person of full legal age who resides at the premises to which 
service  is  delivered  shall  be  deemed  to  receive  benefit  of  service  supplied  and  shall  be  liable  to  the 
Company for payment, subject to conditions hereinafter stated, whether or not service is listed in his/her 
name.  The primary obligor for payment is the applicant or user in whose name service with the Company 
is listed ( Customer of record ).  The Company is obligated to pursue reasonable and timely efforts to 
effect payment by or collections from the Customer of record.  In the event such efforts are unavailing, and 
it is necessary for the Company to effect payment by or collection from a user who is not the Customer of 
record by transfer of an account or otherwise, the Company shall give prior written notice to said user that 
he/she  may  factually  dispute  the  applicability  of  the  benefit  of  service  rule  stated  in  this  paragraph  to 
his/her specific situation by making written complaint to the Commission.  The benefits and obligations of 
the  agreement  for  service  may  not  be  assigned  without  written  consent  of  the  Company.    A  separate 
agreement, if necessary, will be made for each class of service at each separate location. 
Where  rental  properties  are  concerned,  the  Company  will  not  charge  landlords  or  property 
owners  for  electric  service  during  a  period  of  vacancy,  unless  the  landlord  or  property  owner  has 
become  the  Company s  Customer  of  record  as  described  immediately  below.    During  a  period  of 
vacancy in rental properties, the landlord or property owner may contact the Company verbally or in 
writing  to  have  electric  service  transferred  to  his/her  name.    Upon  application  by  the  landlord  or 
property  owner  to  transfer  service  into  his/her  name,  the  landlord  or  property  owner  becomes  the 
Customer of record and service will be provided in the name of the landlord or property owner.  The 
Company reserves the option to discontinue service in accordance with the Discontinuance of Service 
By Company section of these Rules and Regulations in the event the landlord or property owner does 
not elect to transfer service during a period of vacancy.  In the event that the Company has on file a

The  Company  shall  not  assess  a  deposit  from  applicant  if  an  applicant  has  a 
 
satisfactory  payment  record  where  said  previous  service  was  provided  for  a  continuous 
 
period  of  at  least  twelve  (12)  Months  and  applicant's  service  was  not  discontinued  for 
 
delinquent  payment  during  the  last  twelve  (12)  Months  of  said  service  and  applicant 
 
received  no  more  than  two  (2)  Notices  of  Discontinuance  during  the  last  twelve  (12) 
 
Months of said service.  Service must have ended no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to 
 
date of application of service. 
 
In lieu of deposits required under (2) above, an existing Customer of the Company who has 
 
established a satisfactory credit rating with the Company in accordance with (3) above may 
 
become a guarantor for an applicant by signing a written guarantee of payment agreement.  
 
Signing of this agreement guarantees payment of service to be rendered to the applicant up 
 
to the amount of deposit that would have been required by Customer, and shall make the 
 
guarantor's  service  subject  to  discontinuance  in  event  the  guaranteed  bills  are  not 
 
satisfactorily paid. 
 
Deposits shall be refunded after a twelve (12) Month period if no delinquency resulting in a 
 
written notification of disconnection to Customer has occurred.  Thereafter, review will be 
 
made Monthly or upon Customer request to determine if Customer is eligible for refund.  
 
Refunds will otherwise be made only at such time as service is discontinued at Customer's 
 
request and all outstanding bills have been paid.  Interest at the current rate of 0.74 percent 
 
per annum shall be paid on Customer deposits.  Interest will be paid upon refund of the 
R 
deposit  or  annually  upon  request  of  a  Customer.    The  interest  rate  is  subject  to  change 
 
January 1st of each Year in accordance with the Commission Rules.  Whenever the interest 
 
rate is changed, deposits held by the Company shall earn interest at the new rate for the 
 
portion of time the deposit is held beyond the effective date of the interest rate change. 
 
If any required deposit remains unpaid thirty (30) days following the due date of the bill on 
 
which it first appeared, the Customer's service shall be subject to discontinuance on fifteen 
 
(15) days' notice.

An act of subterfuge shall result in the billing of a required deposit.  Subterfuge includes, 
but is not limited to, the use of a fictitious name by applicant for service to avoid paying 
prior  indebtedness  to  Company;  or  an  application  for  service  at  a  given  location  in  the 
name of another party by a Customer whose account is delinquent and who continues to 
reside at the premises. 
Any  deposit  as  required  herein  is  not  to  be  considered  as  advance  payment  or  partial 
payment of any bill for service and shall not be transferable.  The deposit is security for 
payment for service and is to be applied against unpaid bills only in the event service for 
the account on which the deposit was being held as security is no longer provided. 
For purposes of this section, this policy applies to those Commercial and Industrial Customers who 
 
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEPOSITS AND REFUNDS 
 
do not qualify under the Residential and Small Commercial Deposits and Refunds. 
 
Any first-time applicant for Commercial and Industrial Service shall be required to make a deposit 
of an estimated ninety (90) days' bill.  Any applicant who is a former Customer of the Company but who 
did not have Commercial or Industrial Service for at least twenty-four (24) Months within the last three (3) 
Years  shall  be  considered  a  first-time  applicant.    A  former  Commercial  or  Industrial  Customer  of  the 
Company whose previous service was provided for at least twenty-four (24) Months within the last three 
(3) Years and whose payment history was satisfactory, shall not be required to make a deposit. 
 
Any  applicant  for  Commercial  or  Industrial  Service  at  additional  locations  will  be  required  to 
make a Customer deposit of an estimated ninety (90) days' bill at the new location unless said applicant 
has maintained a satisfactory payment record on all other Commercial or Industrial Service accounts.  Any 
time a Customer changes location, payment history will be reviewed and if not satisfactory, the Company 
will request a deposit or an additional deposit; total deposit not to exceed an estimated ninety (90) days' 
bill at the new location.  Satisfactory payment history shall consist of no Discontinuance of Service for 
nonpayment, and not more than two (2) Notices of Discontinuance being incurred on any account during 
the most recent twelve (12) Months' period of which none were mailed within the most recent six (6) 
Months.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEPOSITS AND REFUNDS   Cont d 
 
The above deposit requirements are subject to the following considerations: 
(1)   A surety bond or an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution will be accepted 
in lieu of a deposit but must be issued for an amount equal to the required deposit and be 
issued for a two (2) Year period.  In the event a Customer has not maintained a satisfactory 
payment record as described in the deposit refund provisions below, a surety bond or letter 
of  credit  will  be  required  beyond  two  (2)  Years  and  until  such  time  as  a  satisfactory 
payment record is maintained. 
(2)   An  applicant  for  Commercial  or  Industrial  Service  may  have  the  option  of  having  a 
commercial  credit  report  obtained  by  the  Company  from  a  commercial  credit  reporting 
agency acceptable to the Company.  The report must be requested in the exact name to 
appear on the account.  If such report indicates that all bills equal to or greater than the total 
Monthly estimated gas/electric bills are paid within sixty (60) days of receipt, the deposit 
will not be required.  This option is not available when the applicant has other Commercial 
account(s)  with  the  Company  on  which  satisfactory  payment  history  has  not  been 
established. 
 
If the service location should have a Commercial gas classification, and has two (2) Residential 
electric meters or one (1) electric meter being billed as two (2) Residential living units, the service will be 
considered as Residential class, only for the purpose of determining if a deposit is required. 
 
An existing Commercial or Industrial Customer whose service is terminated for nonpayment will 
be required to make a deposit or an additional deposit prior to restoration of service, but total deposit is not 
to exceed an estimated ninety (90) days' bill.  At any time an existing Customer receives a fourth Notice of 
Discontinuance within the most recent six (6) Months' period, the Customer will be subject to the deposit 
requirements as described herein.  Customer deposits will be required in cases involving subterfuge.

MONTHLY BILLS 
Bills for service will be rendered Monthly.  The Company reserves the right to require payment of 
bills for service at more frequent intervals.  In such event, meters will be read at the intervals specified by 
the Company.  If the Company is unable to read a meter after reasonable effort, the Customer will be 
billed on an estimated usage based on the best available information. 
For  Residential  and  Commercial  Customers  without  interval  data  metering,  the  Company  will 
prorate an initial or a  final  bill  for  a  period less than the scheduled Monthly billing period based on 
consumption from either an actual or estimated meter read. Regardless of the length of the shortened 
Monthly  billing  period  for  the  initial  or  final  bill,  the  Company  will  prorate  the  Monthly  minimum 
charges under the applicable rate schedule for initial and final bills based on the number of days in the 
shortened billing period divided by thirty (30) days.  Prorating will not be applicable to the Monthly 
minimum charges for the final bill if notice to discontinue service is received by the Company within 
four (4) days of the end of the Customer s Monthly billing period.  For final bills, upon notification by 
Customer  to  Company  of  Customer s  desire  to  terminate  service  as  set  forth  in  Discontinuance  of 
Service By Customer sections of the Rules and Regulations, if the Company has not read the meter for a 
regular  meter  reading  within  the  previous  thirty  (30)  days,  the  Company  shall  read  the  meter  to 
determine the consumption for billing the final bill to a Customer.  If the Company has read the meter 
within the past thirty (30) days, the Company will advise the Customer to select one (1) of three (3) 
options to determine the final bill consumption.  The first option is to allow the Company to estimate 
the Customer s consumption based upon the Customer s historic billing data.  The second option is for 
the Customer to read their meter on the day of termination and send or call in that information to the 
Company.  Third option is the Customer can request to have the Company read the meter and pay a 
non-regularly  scheduled  final  meter  reading  charge  under  the  Company s  Schedule  of  Charges  for 
Rendering Service.  The Company shall perform said meter reading within three (3) days from the date 
to discontinue service.  For the purpose of this special meter reading, such three (3) calendar day shall 
not include Sundays or Holidays. 
For Commercial and Industrial Customers with interval data metering, the Company shall prepare 
an initial or final bill using the actual interval metering data. However, for an initial or a final bill for a 
period less than the scheduled Monthly billing period the Company will prorate the applicable Monthly 
minimum charges consistent with the prorate method described above.

ELECTRIC SERVICE 
GENERAL 
 
MONTHLY BILLS   Cont d 
The Company will determine at its sole discretion whether or not to physically shut off service 
upon a shutoff request by Customer, in the instance that the service may revert to a landlord or property 
owner, such shut-off will be consistent with the provisions in the Benefit of Service section of the Rules 
and Regulations.  
For an initial bill other than for a Customer with an interval data meter, the initial or beginning 
meter register, by default, is the final meter reading for the previous Customer.  However, in the event that 
there  exists  an  interim  period  of  time  when  the  Company  does  not  have  a  Customer  of  record,  the 
Company shall adjust the initial or beginning meter register by prorating the consumption based on the 
number of days in the  billing period of service for such Customer. 
All  bills  for  service,  including  any  excise  tax  imposed  by  governmental  authority,  are  due  and 
payable at an office of the Company, or to an authorized agent of the Company, not later than the due date 
shown on the bill.  The bill will be considered as received by the Customer when mailed to, or left at, the 
location where service is used or at some other location that has been mutually agreed upon.  Final bills, 
weekly  bills,  special  bills,  and  bills  for  connection  and  reconnection  are  due  on  presentation.    If  the 
Customer fails to receive a bill, the Company, upon request, will issue a duplicate.  However, failure to 
receive a bill in no way exempts the Customer from payment for service rendered. 
When Company for any reason submits a bill to a Customer for utility service which contains an 
estimated reading or a no charge, Company will include on such bill a notice informing Customer that the 
bill  does  contain  an  estimate  or  no  charge.    Also  included on such bill will be a statement requesting 
Customer  to  call  Company  so  an  accurate  meter  reading  may  be  obtained.    In  all  bills  for  additional 
charges resulting from a period of estimated or skipped billings, Company will include a written notice of 
Customer's right to pay such additional charges in installments, where such charges were not the result of 
meter inaccessibility and Customer's refusal to read his or her own meter. 
If a Customer gives notice at the Company's office prior to the time that payment is due that the 
correctness of the bill is disputed, stating reasons therefore, the Company will investigate the complaint.  
However,  such  notice  disputing  correctness  of  a  bill  shall  not  be  sufficient  reason  for  withholding 
payment.  If the bill is found to be incorrect, the Company will refund the amount of overpayment or credit 
the amount of overpayment to the next bill rendered.

CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD PAYMENT OPTION 
 
Customers served under Residential, Commercial and Industrial Service Rates may elect, at their 
option, to pay their Monthly utility bill for electric service with a credit or debit card.  Customers electing 
to pay with a credit or debit card will be charged a per transaction convenience fee as set forth on the 
Company s Schedule of Charges for Rendering Service for credit or debit card.  Payment option is not 
applicable to any charge under the Distribution Extension Policy.

Customers served under Residential, Commercial and Industrial Service Rates who have no Notice 
 
of Discontinuance of Service pending may elect, at their option, to pay Monthly bills for service on an 
 
Averaged  Monthly  Payment  Plan  beginning  with  any  billing  Month.    Customers  served  under  rate 
 
Schedules SST, PST and TST as well as seasonal Commercial or Industrial Customers are not eligible for 
 
service on an Averaged Monthly Payment Plan.  A seasonal  Customer shall be a  Customer whose in-
 
season billing demands for a minimum of six (6) consecutive billing Months equal or exceed seventy-five 
 
percent  (75%)  of  the  highest  measured  demand  occurring  during  said  period  and  whose  off-season 
 
measured demand during the prior off-season is less than thirty percent (30%) of the maximum in-season 
 
measured demand for a minimum of three consecutive Billing Months. 
 
 
Residential, and Small Commercial Customers electing the Averaged Monthly Payment Plan shall 
 
pay a Monthly amount equal to the estimated total annual bill divided by twelve (12).  The estimated total 
 
annual bill is calculated based on a Customer s most recent twelve (12) Months  consumption and the 
 
then current rates of the Company.  If the Customer s consumption information is available for less than 
 
twelve (12) Months, the available consumption information will be annualized to a common denominator 
 
of  365  days.    Unless  a  review  on  the  subsequent  fourth  (4th),  seventh  (7th)  or  tenth  (10th)  Month 
 
following the initial averaged Monthly payment Month shows an annual payment surplus or deficiency 
 
that exceeds an annual variance threshold, the average Monthly payment shall be paid by the Customer for 
D 
eleven (11) Months.  The twelfth Month's payment shall be a settlement amount equal to the difference 
 
between the total of the prior eleven (11) Months' payments and the actual billings for the twelve (12) 
 
Month period. 
 
 
This annual variance threshold is subject to change by the Company and is a fixed dollar amount 
D 
applicable to each residential or commercial Customer for the remaining Months of the Averaged Monthly 
 
Payment  Plan  Year.  Adjustments to the averaged  Monthly payment amount will only be made to the 
 
remaining  Months,  either  up  or  down,  if the annual payment deficiency or surplus exceeds the annual 
 
variance threshold.

AVERAGED  MONTHLY  PAYMENT  PLAN  FOR  RESIDENTIAL  AND  SMALL  COMMERCIAL 
CUSTOMERS   Cont d 
 
The  change  in  averaged  Monthly  payment,  if  applicable,  is  the  amount  of  annual  payment 
surplus or deficiency divided by the remaining Months of the Averaged Monthly Payment Plan Year. 
The  annual  payment  surplus  or  deficiency  is  the  sum  of  1)  the  difference  between  the  amount  of 
Customer s payments and the actual payments due over the Months in the review period and 2) the change 
in the estimated total bill for the remaining Months of the Customer s Averaged Monthly Payment Plan 
Year based on a change in consumption pattern and/or current rates effective at the time of the review.  
The settlement Month shall be the twelfth Month of the Averaged Monthly Payment Plan Year. 
Averaged Monthly Payment Plan Customers with a settlement amount, if the settlement amount is 
 
a credit balance the Company will issue a check to the Customer in the amount of the credit balance, or the 
Customer may elect to have the credit applied to future billings. 
 
The  Customer  may  continue  on  the  Averaged  Monthly  Payment  Plan  for  succeeding  Years,  in 
which case the settlement Month for each Year will occur in twelve (12) Month cycles starting with the 
beginning Month. 
 
If  a  Customer  electing  the  Averaged  Monthly  Payment Plan fails to pay the averaged  Monthly 
payment obligation in any Month, normal collection procedures shall be applicable for the outstanding 
averaged Monthly payment amount.  Upon termination of service of a Customer or upon a Customer s 
election to discontinue billing on the Averaged Monthly Payment Plan, the Customer will be removed 
from the plan and the entire outstanding amount of the account for actual usage shall be due and payable. 
 
The Monthly, averaged Monthly payment amount will be adjusted for changes in the Company's 
base  rates,  changes  in  general  rate  schedule  adjustments  and  other  cost  adjustments  that  result  in  an 
increase or decrease in the Customers averaged Monthly payment amount above or below the corporate-
wide annual threshold.

MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE 
 
The Company will install, own, and maintain suitable metering and other equipment necessary for 
measuring  the  electric  energy  supplied  in  accordance  with  Company's  Electric  Installation  Standards.  
Each class of electric service supplied will be metered and billed separately.  All service to a Customer 
under one (1) applicable rate schedule at each Point of Delivery will be measured by a single meter and 
meter  readings  will  not  be  combined  for  billing  purposes.    Provided,  however,  where  existing  water 
heating service has been separately metered or where all service is supplied at a single Point of Delivery 
but is separately metered because of municipal code, or the Company determines that the readings of two 
(2) or more meters may be combined for billing purposes.  Adjoining properties may be combined on a 
single  meter  at  the  Customer's  expense,  and  served  as  a  single  Customer  where  such  properties  are 
controlled, occupied, and used for commercial purposes by a single enterprise engaged in the pursuit of a 
single business. 
 
Customers. 
 
Service  to  the  same  person  at  different  premises  will  be  considered  as  service  to  separate 
Residential Service 
For Residential Service, the Company shall normally provide a single meter to a home but 
will allow a second service and meter only to a separate, permanent structure on a single property.  
If a Residential Customer requests three (3) or more Point(s) of Delivery for an additional building 
or permanent structure (i.e. detached garage/barn), such structure must be greater than two hundred 
and fifty feet (250 ft.) apart from structures already served by the Company.  In such an event, the 
Company shall apply the Capacity Requirement section of the Electric Installation Standards to 
determine if it will allow an additional service and meter such that the capacity limitation is tied to 
the Company s ability to extend the existing service over such distance to provide adequate service 
with acceptable voltage drop and/or flicker.  In all instances, each meter will be billed separately 
and  meter  readings  will  not  be  combined  for  billing  purposes,  except  for  Production  Metering 
under  Schedule  NM.    Separate  or  additional  metering  for  Residential  Service  in  multiple  units 
shall be subject to the rules and regulations for Commercial/Industrial Secondary Voltage Service 
herein.    The  Company  shall  require  a  second  meter  or  a  Production  Meter  to  measure  the 
Customer s generation output.

The Company shall provide a second or multiple Point(s) of Delivery after its review and approval 
of  the  exception  request.  Additional  services/meters  as  referenced  under  the  Different 
Characteristics section of the  Electric Installation Standards are not permitted.  In all instances, 
each meter will be billed separately and meter readings will not be combined for billing purposes, 
except for Production Metering under Schedule NM. The Company shall require a second meter or 
a Production Meter to measure the Customer s generation output. 
For  Secondary  Voltage  Service  to  a  retail  strip  mall  or  separate  tenant  for  horizontal 
applications  in  a  single  building,  the  Company  will  allow  a  meter  for  each  unit  as  long  as the 
following conditions are met at the time of the electric meter set:

3. 
The county, city and/or fire protection district permits the installation by giving an 
electrical inspection release for each meter housing, whether or not the walls are 
installed separating the units. 
The  Company  completes  a  meter  trace  verification  and  confirms  that  no 
intermingling of wiring exists between the units. 
There is a separate entrance and an exit in each unit and there is not any ingress or 
egress  between  tenant spaces or interior common areas not served by a separate 
entity unless a tenant has rented one or more spaces.

DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE AT CUSTOMER'S REQUEST 
A Customer wishing to discontinue or terminate service shall give at least three (3) days' notice to 
allow the Company time to render a meter reading and issue a final bill.  The Company shall perform said 
meter  reading  within  three  (3)  days  from  the  date  to  discontinue  service  subject  to  the  Monthly  Bills 
section of this Electric Tariff.  For the purpose of this special meter reading, such three (3) calendar day 
shall not include Sundays or Holidays.  The Company may prorate and estimate the final bill for a period 
less than the Monthly billing period if the Customer wants to discontinue service on a date other than the 
end date of his/her Monthly Billing Period, as described in the Monthly Bills section of this Electric Tariff. 
Where notice to discontinue or terminate service is not provided by the Customer, the Customer 
will be liable for payment of service until such time the Company is made aware of the discontinuance and 
can render a final reading of the meter.  Notice by a Customer to discontinue or terminate service will not 
relieve the  Customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment under a contract or an applicable rate 
schedule.

Any Residential Customer having provided Company a valid medical certificate may request an 
installment payment plan arrangement on or before the last day covered by the medical certificate.  Any 
Residential Customer who had already entered into an installment payment plan arrangement and who had 
not broken arrangements prior to invoking medical certification provisions may renegotiate the installment 
payment plan arrangement on or before the last day covered by the medical certification.  Any Residential 
Customer who defaulted on said prior arrangements must pay, on or before the last day covered by the 
medical certification, all amounts that would have been paid up to that date had arrangements not been 
broken, and resume the installment payment plan arrangement, in order to avoid discontinuance of service. 
 
If  Discontinuance  of  Service  involves  individual  permanent  residents  of  multi-unit  dwellings 
where service for the entire multi-unit dwelling is supplied through one (1) meter and Company is aware 
of such condition, discontinuance of service shall occur only after Company has given thirty (30) days  
notice of intent to terminate to the party responsible for payment of utility bills for the dwelling and to 
individual  occupants  of  each  unit  within  the  dwelling.    Notice  to  such  individual  occupants  shall  be 
delivered to each dwelling unit or mailed to the addressee or occupant of each unit. In addition, a copy of 
said notice shall be posted, to the extent possible, in at least one (1) of the common areas of the multi-unit 
dwelling.  Occupants of a multi-unit dwelling may avoid termination by agreeing to pay each new bill 
within thirty (30) days of issuance.  Occupants so agreeing shall not be entitled to installment payments or 
any other payment plan and may be discontinued without further notice or attempt at personal contact for 
failure to pay each new bill within thirty (30) days of issuance. 
 
Discontinuance of Service shall not occur between noon on Friday and 8:00 a.m. the following 
Monday or between noon on the day prior to and 8:00 a.m. on the day following any federal Holiday or 
Company observed Holiday. 
 
Company may discontinue service without notice: 
(1) 
If the condition or installation of any part of the Customer lines, apparatus, or appliances is 
found to be dangerous to life, health, and safety of any person or is found to damage the 
Company s system by exceeding system capacity or overloading the Company s facilities, 
the Company may discontinue service without notice.  The Customer shall be required to 
either correct the overloading condition or installation by reducing their load and paying 
the Company for system damages, which will avoid the need for system reinforcements, or 
pay the Company the necessary costs to reinforce the system to eliminate the impact to the 
system  of  the  overloading  condition  or  installation.    The  Company  does  not  assume 
responsibility and will not be held responsible for ascertaining such condition.

discontinuance or termination has occurred due to breached arrangements.  If service is discontinued or 
terminated  after  breach  of  arrangements,  service  will  be  reinstituted  only  after  Customer  has  made 
payment  in  full  of  all  amounts  owed,  including  any  collection  and/or  reconnection  charges  and  after 
posting any deposit required for service. 
 
and will not be discontinued or terminated again until said medical certificate has expired.

restore such service within twenty-four (24) hours (excluding weekends and Holidays), or within twelve 
(12) hours if the Customer pays any necessary after-hours charges after elimination by Customer of the 
cause for discontinuance, unless extenuating circumstances prevent restoral.  See Schedule of Charges for 
Rendering Service for after-hours charges.  Extenuating circumstances includes, but are not limited to, the 
requirement that the Customer or someone designated by the Customer be at the premises at the time of

constituted authority applicable to his/her electric service.  The Company does not assume 
responsibility and will not be held responsible for ascertaining such condition. 
If service is found to have been restored by someone other than Company and the original 
cause for the discontinuance has not been cured. 
(2) 
(3) 
For purposes of this section, this policy applies to those commercial and industrial Customers who 
 
RESTORATION OF SERVICE   COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
 
do not qualify under the Residential and Small Commercial Deposit and Refunds. 
 
Service which has been discontinued or terminated due to failure to pay or make arrangements for 
payment of bills for service rendered will be restored if Customer pays one-half of the amount shown on 
the notice of discontinuation or termination, all applicable collection or reconnection charges, or enters 
into  an  installment  payment  plan  arrangement  to  pay  the  remaining  account  balance  in  equal  Monthly 
installments over a period of time not to exceed three (3) Months.  This provision will not apply in cases 
where termination has occurred due to breached arrangements.  If service is terminated after breach of 
arrangements, service will be reinstituted only after Customer has made payment in full of all amounts 
owed, including any collection or reconnection charges and after posting any deposit required for service. 
 
Where service has been discontinued as set forth in these rules, Company shall restore such service 
within  twenty-four  (24)  hours  (excluding  weekends  and  Holidays),  or  within  twelve  (12)  hours  if  the 
Customer  pays  any  necessary  after-hours  charges  after  elimination  by  Customer  of  the  cause  for 
discontinuance,  unless  extenuating  circumstances  prevent  restoral.    See  Schedule  of  Charges  for 
Rendering Service for after-hours charges.  Extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to, the 
requirement that the Customer or someone designated by the Customer be at the premise at the time of 
restoral.

3. 
4. 
Company will provide, own, operate and maintain the necessary step-down transformers at 
the Point of Delivery designated by the Company or adjacent thereto on Company-owned 
lines. 
Customer  will  provide,  own,  operate  and  maintain  all  other  transformers  as  required 
beyond said Point of Delivery. 
Company will not provide transformers which in opinion of Company are of special types 
or  designs,  nor  provide  transformers  to  serve  Customer  at  voltage  other  than  that  of 
Company's  established  distribution  system  in  the  locality  where  service  is  supplied,  nor

Delivery shall be owned, operated and maintained by Customer. 
 
CUSTOMER'S INSTALLATION 
 
The Customer, before purchasing equipment or beginning construction of a proposed installation, 
shall  confer  with  the  Company  to  determine  if  the  type  of  service,  capacity,  and  voltage  desired  by 
Customer is available; to determine if extensions of, or additions to, Company's facilities will be required; 
and to secure definite location of the Point of Delivery.  Before any additions to or alterations of existing 
installations are made by Customer which will materially affect the amount of service required, or which 
may  require  a  change  in  the  type  of  service  or  the  Point  of  Delivery,  the  Company  must  be  notified 
reasonably in advance thereof as to the proposed additions or alterations in order that the Company may 
first determine if the service desired is available and, if so, that the necessary changes in the Company's

CUSTOMER S INSTALLATION   Cont d 
 
 
For Residential Customers: If, through the course of the Company s evaluation of the electrical 
N 
equipment on the Customer s side of the Point of Delivery during a meter change is noted to not be in 
N 
conformity  with  good  electrical  practice,  with  the  requirements  of  the  National  Electrical  Code,  the 
N 
National  Electrical  Safety  Code,  the  wiring  regulations  of  the  public  body  having  jurisdiction,  or  in 
N 
accordance with the Company's Rules and Regulations, the Company at its sole discretion will facilitate 
N 
with  the  Customer  such  minor  repairs  which  may  include  the  replacement  of  Customer-owned  meter 
N 
housing and socket, but limited to facilities located before the Customer-owned conductor. At all times, 
N 
such  facilities  remain  the  ownership  of  the  Customer  and  the  Company  takes  no  liability  for  future 
N 
modifications or repairs. 
N 
 
If Customer's electrical requirements at more than one (1) building or location make it necessary 
 
that overhead or underground distribution lines, either Primary or Secondary Voltage, or both, be located 
 
between  such  buildings  or  locations,  or  if  service  is  supplied  to  Customer  at  premises  not  adjacent  to 
 
Company's  lines,  the  necessary  distribution  facilities  beyond  the  Point  of  Delivery  shall  be  installed, 
 
owned,  operated,  and  maintained  by  Customer,  provided,  however,  such  facilities  are  located  on  and 
 
traverse only such land that is owned or controlled by Customer, except as otherwise provided herein; and 
 
provided  further,  that  the  installation  of  such  facilities  shall  be  subject  to  the  Company's  approval.  
 
Distribution  facilities which are owned, operated and maintained by a  Customer who is taking service 
 
under a Commercial or Industrial rate may cross dedicated public streets, alleys or other public ways upon 
 
approval  of  Company,  so  long  as  such  facilities  are  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  serving  Customer's 
 
contiguous buildings or property which are separated only by such streets, alleys and ways, and provided 
 
that  such  contiguous  buildings  or  property  are  used  for  an  integral  purpose.    Customer's  distribution 
 
facilities  must  be  installed  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  codes  and  governmental  regulations.  
 
Contiguity of property will be deemed to exist if separation is caused only by the interposition of dedicated 
 
public streets, alleys or other public ways and if the connecting facilities are not required to diagonally 
 
cross such streets, alleys or public ways.  In such cases, the electric energy will be metered at a location 
 
designated by Company, which location may be at a point other than the Point of Delivery.  Customer will 
 
provide, install, operate, and maintain such protective devices as specified and approved by the Company 
 
through which connection is made to Company's distribution system. 
 
 
Where  service  is  supplied  under  a  Primary  Voltage  rate  such  service  shall  be  provided  by  the 
Company  at  a  single  Point  of  Delivery  for  the  Customer s  premise,  all  distribution  facilities  beyond 
Company's primary service connection at the Point of Delivery will be owned, operated and maintained by 
the Customer. 
 
When the Company is required by order of properly constituted authorities to move or alter its 
existing  distribution  system,  thereby  necessitating  a  change  in  the  location  of  the  Customer's  service 
outlets  and  the  Point  of  Delivery,  the  Company  will  designate  a  new  Point  of  Delivery  to  which  the 
Customer, at its expense, will bring its facilities.

CUSTOMER S INSTALLATION   Cont d 
 
Service will be delivered to the Customer for each premise at a Point or Points of Delivery to be 
designated by the Company.  If Customer requests more than one (1) Point of Delivery where Company 
can adequately provide service at a single Point of Delivery, such additional Point or Points of Delivery 
may  be  provided  by  Company  for  installations  greater  than  four  thousand  amperes  (4,000  amps)  as 
determined solely by Company or in accordance with the Measurement of Service section within these 
Rules  and  Regulations.    Except  where  determination  has  been  made  by  Company  that  there  is  an 
operational advantage to it in providing multiple Points of Delivery, electrical service furnished at multiple 
Points of Delivery provided for the convenience of Customer will be billed at each Point of Delivery as a 
separate Customer and the load, Kilowatt Demand and Energy will not be combined for billing purposes.  
Multiple  Points  of  Delivery  must  be  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  codes  and  governmental 
regulations.  For the mutual protection of the Customer and the Company, only authorized employees of 
the Company are permitted to make and energize the connection between the Company's service wire and 
the Customer's service entrance conductors. 
 
If,  for  special  reasons,  the  Customer  requires  or  elects  to  use  voltages  other  than  the  standard 
Secondary  and  Primary  Voltages  of  the  Company's  established  distribution  system,  the  special 
transformers (with necessary spare or emergency units) will be installed, operated and maintained by and 
at the expense of the Customer. 
 
The Company reserves the right to require the Customer to reimburse the Company for any cost 
resulting  from  a  change  in  meters  or  other  apparatus  or  in  their  location  made  at  the  request  of  the 
customer.  Meters and other equipment of the Company will be removed or relocated only by employees 
of the Company. 
 
The Customer, at the request of the Company, will furnish and maintain indoor or underground 
space and facilities for the installation of Company's transformers and other equipment in accordance with 
Electric Installation Standards and specifications for same. 
 
Customer will in every case confer with Company before any special apparatus or any apparatus 
requiring extremely close voltage regulation is connected.  In the event that any equipment is connected to 
the Company's lines the operation of which impairs service to other Customers, the Company reserves the 
right to require correction of the condition by Customer.  Company may refuse or discontinue service to 
such equipment until such condition is corrected by Customer.

ELECTRIC SERVICE 
GENERAL 
 
CUSTOMER S INSTALLATION   Cont d 
In  certain  circumstances  the  use  of  welding  machines,  X-ray  machines,  elevators  or  other 
equipment having fluctuating or intermittent load characteristics, or having an abnormal effect on voltage, 
may necessitate the furnishing of service to such equipment through isolated transformers and separate 
service drops, or installing transformer and/or line capacity in excess of that normally required by non-
fluctuating or non-intermittent equipment in order to protect the quality of service to Customer, or to other 
Customers.  The Company reserves the right to charge the Customer the full cost of facilities necessary to 
provide any special service required by such equipment and/or to prevent any impairment in service to 
Customer or to other Customers.  Where Customer is billed under a Measured Demand, Company may 
determine the Billing Demand on a shorter interval than fifteen (15) minutes, or may make other suitable 
adjustment, irrespective of any provision relative to Billing Demand determination contained in any such 
rate. 
 
Company's  rates  contemplate  Customer's  use  of  service  at  a  Power  Factor,  at  the  point  where 
service is metered, of not less than ninety percent (90%) lagging.  When neon,  fluorescent, or other types 
of lighting, or other inherently low Power Factor equipment is used, such equipment must be provided 
with suitable Power Factor corrective equipment so that the resultant Power Factor of such equipment is 
not  less  than  ninety  percent  (90%)  lagging.    Company  reserves  the  right  to  discontinue  service  to  any 
Customer not complying herewith.

EASEMENTS 
 
A contract for electric service including an Applicant under an Extension Agreement, or receipt of 
service by  Customer, will be construed as an agreement granting to Company an easement for electric 
lines,  wires,  conduits,  and  other  equipment  of  Company  necessary  to  render  service  to  Customer.    If 
requested  by  Company,  Customer  will  execute  Company's  standard  form  of  right-of-way  agreement, 
granting to Company, at no expense therefore, satisfactory easements for suitable location of Company's 
wires,  conduits,  poles,  transformers,  metering  equipment,  and  other  appurtenances  on  or  across  lands 
owned  or  controlled  by  Customer,  and  will  furnish  space  and  shelter  satisfactory  to  Company  for  all 
apparatus  of  Company  located  on  Customer's  property.    In  the  event  that  Customer  shall  divide  its 
property by sale or otherwise in such manner that one (1) part shall be isolated from streets or alleys where 
Company's  electric  lines  are  accessible,  Customer  shall  be  deemed  to  have  granted  or  reserved  an 
easement for electric service over the part having access to electric lines for the benefit of the isolated part, 
and without limiting the automatic nature of such grant or reservation, Customer shall confirm such grant 
or  reservation  in  the  document  creating  the  division  or  in  another  document  executed,  delivered  and 
recorded contemporaneously therewith. 
 
ATTACHMENTS TO COMPANY'S POLES 
 
No posters, banners, placards, radio or television aerials, or other objects will be attached to poles 
of  the  Company  including  street  light  poles  unless  the  Company  provides  written  approval  under  the 
provisions  of  the  Street  Lighting  section  within  these  Rules  and  Regulations.    The  Company  will  not 
install,  or  permit  installation  of,  the  Customer's  distribution  wires  or  equipment  on  Company's  poles 
including street light poles, except for:  wires for municipal fire alarm or police signal systems, Customer-
owned yard light and other equipment as required on farm poles, attachment of Customer underground 
service  extension  from  overhead system, and other joint use agreements, and the  Customer's dead end 
equipment.

DIVERSION OF ELECTRIC ENERGY 
 
The existence of electric energy consuming devices installed ahead of the Service Meter or Point 
of  Delivery  any  tampering  or  interfering  with  wires,  devices,  or  equipment  connected  to  Company's 
distribution system or the damage to, alteration, or obstruction of any meter (including the breaking of 
meter seals) which will permit or make possible the use of electric energy without its proper registration 
on Company's meter shall constitute prima facie evidence of diversion of electric energy by the Customer 
in whose name service is being rendered, or by the person benefiting from the use of such diverted electric 
energy.  In the event that a Company check meter registers more electric energy in the same interval of 
time than does the meter installed at Customer's premises, after such meters shall have been tested and 
found to be registering within the limits of accuracy prescribed by the Commission, such fact shall also 
constitute prima facie evidence of diversion of electric energy. 
 
In such instances, the Company will, in any reasonable manner, compute the amount of diverted 
electric  energy  and  shall  have  the  right  to  enter  Customer's  premises  and  make  an  actual  count  of  all 
electric energy consuming devices to aid in such computation.  Where the Company is unable to make 
such  count,  the  computation  will  be  based  upon  any  other  available  information,  or  estimated.    Such 
computation or estimate shall be made for the period beginning with the date on which Customer began 
using electric energy at the location where the diversion occurred, unless evidence proves the diversion 
commenced at a later date, and ending with the date on which such diversion ceased.  Bills for electric 
energy diverted, based upon the aforesaid computation or, where necessary, upon estimation, under the 
applicable rate in effect during the period of diversion, plus the cost of investigating and confirming such 
diversion, disconnecting service, equipment damages and other related items shall be due and payable in 
accordance with the Company's tariffs. 
 
If  service  has  been  discontinued  for  failure  to  comply  with  any  of  the  Company's  Rules  and 
Regulations  and  a  diversion  of  electric  energy  has  been  confirmed  subsequent  to  discontinuance,  the 
Company will not render service to the Customer, or to any other person for Customer's use, until:  (1) the 
Customer  has  paid  or  made  appropriate  arrangements  (when  applicable)  with  the  Company  for  the 
payment of all charges relating to the diversion of electric energy and for all past due bills for service 
rendered  at  the  same  location;  and  (2)  the  Company  confirms  that the cause for the discontinuance of 
electric  service,  if  other  than  for  non-payment,  has  been  cured.    Payment  arrangements  shall  not  be 
available in any case where the Customer has defaulted on an installment payment arrangement. 
 
If service has been discontinued for diversion of electric energy and the Customer has in the past 
refused  or  restricted  access  to  the  Company's  meter  reading  equipment,  the  Company  will  not  render 
service  to  the  Customer  or  to  any  other  person  for  the  Customer's  use,  at  the  same  location  until  the 
Customer  has  arranged  with  the  Company  for  the  installation  of,  or  has  installed  at  the  Customer's 
expense,  such  entrance  and  service  equipment  as  is  necessary  to  prevent  further  diversion  of  electric 
energy.

excepting  only  in  the  case  Customer-owned  generation.    No  other  source  of  electric  energy  shall  be 
connected to any installation attached to the Company's electric distribution system, except as provided 
under the terms and conditions of the Company s Rules and Regulations related to parallel generation. 
 
RESALE OF ELECTRIC ENERGY 
 
Electric service supplied by the Company is for the exclusive use of the Customer.  Consequently, 
the Customer will not be permitted by submetering, to determine a quantity of electric energy and resell 
the  same  as  such  to  any  other  person  or  persons  on  the  Customer's  premises  or  for  use  on  any  other 
premises.  A master-metered Customer may, however, check-meter tenants, lessees, or other persons to 
whom ultimately the electricity is distributed for the purpose of reimbursing the master-metered Customer 
by an appropriate allocation procedure subject to the Commission s Master Meters Rules.  The Company 
reserves the right to refuse to furnish electric service to any Customer where the purchase of such service 
is  for  the  purpose  of  resale  by  Customer  to  others.  In  the  event  electric  energy  is  resold  in  conflict 
herewith, Company shall have the right to discontinue service to Customer.

DEFINITION 
 
Residential  Service  is  the  furnishing  of  electric  energy  for  the  exclusive  use  of  the  individual 
Customer  for  domestic  purposes,  i.e.,  lighting,  refrigeration,  cooking,  water  heating,  space  heating,  air 
conditioning,  and  small  power  service,  in  a  private  home  or  individual  living  unit  where  only  one  (1) 
household is served through a single meter.  Service to buildings appurtenant to the residence including 
garages, barns, and other minor buildings for use of the Customer for Residential Service may also be 
served through the residential meter. 
 
MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS 
 
Service may be supplied under Residential Service rates, to duplex houses, multi-family dwellings, 
rooming houses, apartment houses, mobile homes, or to more than one (1) residence on an integral parcel 
of  land  and  under  one  (1)  ownership  when  requested  by  Customer  or  where,  in  opinion  of  Company, 
service  cannot  otherwise  be  supplied  without  excessive  investment  in  meters  and  lines,  as  applicable. 
Service must be delivered to and paid for by one (1) Customer. 
 
In determining the number of living units for multi-family dwellings, each family dwelling place or 
individual housekeeping unit will be counted as a separate living unit.  In private residences or rooming 
houses where three (3) or more rooms are used as tenant sleeping rooms only and not as housekeeping 
units with kitchen facilities, each three (3) rooms so used will be taken as a separate living unit, to the 
nearest unit.  Where mobile home living units are served through Customer's Residential Service meter, 
each mobile home unit will be considered a separate living unit in the application of the rate.  However, 
temporary connection of a single mobile home will not be considered as establishment of an additional 
living unit.  The number of living units determined as aforesaid will prevail for a minimum period of four 
(4) Months.  Said number will not be changed for vacancies unless such vacancies are to be permanent.  
Customer is responsible for notifying the Company of reductions and Company will bill the Customer on 
the basis of its records until notice of change is received.

CHARACTER AND APPLICABILITY OF SERVICE 
 
Residential Service will be supplied as sixty (60) hertz, single-phase, alternating current electric 
energy at nominally 120/240 volt three-wire service.  If available, Company, at its option, may supply 
three-phase, four-wire, 120/240 volt Delta connected service or three-phase, four-wire 120/208 volt Wye 
connected service.  The Company reserves the right to maintain different nominal voltages in areas where 
the type of distribution makes another nominal voltage advisable. 
 
Three-wire or four-wire service is required where more than two (2) circuits are supplied through 
the meter and for motor, heating, water heating, air conditioning, and/or range load, or where required by 
the applicable Wiring Code.  Where three-wire or four-wire service is supplied, the load must be balanced 
as nearly as practicable between the sides or phases. 
 
Where  existing  water  heating  service  is  separately  metered,  and  where  Customer  is  receiving 
service under the Residential General (Schedule R) rate schedule, the Monthly water heating consumption 
so metered shall be added to the consumption metered on the Residential Service rate meter.  If Customer 
requests  service  under  any  other  Residential  rate  schedule,  Customer's  wiring  must  be  combined  at 
Customer's expense in order to receive all service through a single meter. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS 
 
Residential  Service  rates  are  not  applicable  to  service  for  commercial  enterprises,  except  as 
specifically provided herein.  Commercial enterprises will include but not be limited to clubs, fraternities, 
sororities, lodges, hotels, apartment and rooming houses, motels, mobile home parks, campgrounds, multi-
family dwellings where more than one (1) dwelling or one (1) living unit is served through a single meter, 
schools, municipal buildings, churches, eleemosynary institutions, greenhouses or other indoor growing 
facilities,  dairies,  manufacturing,  agricultural,  livestock  production,  mining,  oil  and  gas  extraction,

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
 
DEFINITION 
 
Commercial and Industrial Service is the furnishing of electric energy for the exclusive use of the 
individual Commercial or Industrial Customer.  Any establishment engaged in the operation of a business, 
whether or not for profit, shall be considered as a Commercial or Industrial enterprise.  Such enterprises 
will  include  but  not  be  limited  to  clubs,  fraternities,  sororities,  lodges,  hotels,  apartment  and  rooming 
houses, motels, mobile home parks, campgrounds, multi-family dwellings where more than one (1) living 
unit is served through one (1) meter, schools, municipal buildings, churches, eleemosynary institutions, 
greenhouses,  dairies,  manufacturing,  agricultural,  livestock  production,  mining,  oil  and  gas  extraction, 
construction, communication, transportation, etc.  Certain types of dwellings may be served on Residential 
Service rates and be classified Residential Service, as specifically set forth in the Residential Rules and 
Regulations.  Any portion of service to Residential type dwellings that does not qualify for Residential 
Service  under  the  Residential  Service  Rules  and  Regulations  or  Residential  Service  rates  shall  be 
separately metered and served under Commercial or Industrial Service rates. 
With respect to billing adjustments due to billing error, small Commercial service shall be any 
 
service supplied by Company under a Secondary Voltage rate schedule where the Customer s demand is 
not  greater  than  twenty-five  Kilowatts  (25kW)  for  any  Month  over  the  previous  twelve  (12)  Months.  
Agricultural Customers are considered Small Commercial Customers. 
 
SERVICE CONDITIONS 
 
 
 
General 
 
Commercial or Industrial Service to be supplied will be under appropriate rates and Rules 
and  Regulations  dependent upon whether the load requirements are single-phase or three-phase 
and whether deliveries are needed at Primary or Secondary Voltage levels.  Service to be supplied 
is dependent on Company's available facilities and voltages and is also subject to requirements and 
conditions of Company's Service Connection and Distribution Line Extension Policy. 
 
Commercial  or  Industrial  Service  may,  with  Company  approval,  be  supplied  at 
Transmission Voltages in situations involving large loads and where transmission line service is 
feasible  in  accordance  with  good  engineering  practices.    Such transmission service will require 
Customer construction payment for all transmission facility construction costs, connection costs 
and other associated costs.

Load Balance 
 
Where three-phase service is supplied, Customer will attempt to connect its equipment so 
that the load in any one (1) phase at the Point of Delivery will not exceed the load in any other 
phase by more than fifteen percent (15%). 
Instantaneous Demand 
 
Under no circumstances will motors be served from Company's system if the size of said 
motor  exceeds  the  limitations  for  the  conditions  of  the  installation  as  set  forth  in  Company's 
Electric Installation Standards.  Company reserves the right to impose similar restrictions, limiting 
the initial current input, on other types of electrical apparatus. 
Protection of Customer's Equipment 
 
Company's recommendations for protection of Customer's equipment against low voltage, 
phase  reversal,  and  single-phase  operation  are  set  forth  in  the  Company s  Electric  Installation 
Standards. 
Customer, at all times, will maintain at Company's Point of Delivery a Power Factor as 
Power Factor 
 
near unity as practicable. 
 
In  the  event  a  low  voltage  condition  due  to  lagging  Power  Factor  exists  in  a  degree 
sufficient  to  impair  the  Company's  service,  Customer  will  install  suitable  capacitor  or  other 
equipment necessary to raise the over-all Power Factor at the Point of Delivery to a satisfactory 
value.  Where such Power Factor correction equipment is used, Customer will install and maintain 
a  relay,  switch,  or  other  regulating  equipment  for  purpose  of  disconnecting  or  controlling  the 
Power Factor correction equipment in order to prevent excessive voltage variations on Company's 
lines.

Determination of Billing Demands 
 
the following provisions: 
Billing Demands will be determined as set forth in the applicable rate schedule, subject to 
1. 
2. 
3. 
If the load is of intermittent or fluctuating character or requires frequent starting 
with  high  starting  current,  the  Company  may  take  as  the  Billing  Demand  the 
maximum amount of power used at any one (1) time, or may add to the Measured 
Demand fifty percent (50%) of the maximum requirements of the intermittent or 
fluctuating load, or may make other suitable corrections, provided that the Billing 
Demand  will  not  be  taken  as  less  than  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  the  maximum 
instantaneous load. 
If three-phase service is provided and Customer's equipment is so connected that at 
the Point of Delivery the load on any one (1) phase exceeds the load on any other 
phase by more than fifteen percent (15%), the Company may take as the Billing 
Demand the three-phase equivalent of the maximum kilovolt-amperes in any phase 
adjusted to a ninety percent (90%) Power Factor. 
The  rated  capacity  in  KVA  of  equipment  having  fluctuating  and/or  intermittent 
load characteristics, such as transformer-type welders, X-ray machines, and other 
equipment  of  similar  characteristics  will  be  the  full-load  primary  input  to  the 
equipment, determined by Company by one (1) of the following methods: 
a. 
The  name-plate  data  of  the  equipment,  if  such  data  reveal  the  full-load 
primary input, or 
By measurement with suitable instruments of the primary input under full-
load conditions, or 
By  the  KVA  of  transformer  capacity  necessary  to  properly  supply  the 
equipment.

The  Customer  shall  install  and  maintain  adequate  protection  equipment  in  accordance  with  the 
Company s  Interconnection  Guidelines  for  Small  Power  Producers,  Customer-owned  Generators  and 
Non-utility  Generators,  or  Interconnection  Guidelines  for  Transmission  Interconnected Producer-owned 
Generation Greater Than 20MW as applicable and also be subject to the rules for safety and reliability set 
forth  by  the  Commission,  all  of  which  are  subject  to  change  from  time  to  time.  All  Customers  with 
synchronous generators will be subject to special safety requirements including start up and shut down 
notification  as  set  forth  in  the  Company s  Interconnection  Guidelines  for  Small  Power  Producers, 
Customer-owned Generators and Non-utility Generators or Interconnection Guidelines for Transmission 
Interconnected Producer-owned Generation Greater Than 20MW, as applicable. 
In addition to an automatic fail-safe device, the Company will require the Customer to install at 
Customer s  expense,  an  accessible  disconnection  device  having  the  capability  of  isolating  the  energy 
generated by the  Customer.  Either party may operate this device at any time in order to maintain safe 
operating conditions. 
 
All  Customers  prior  to  receiving  service  under  the  Standby  Service  shall  execute  an  Electric 
Standby Service Agreement with the Company, which will specify the total Standby capacity requirements 
for  which  Company  will  be  providing  Standby  power  and  energy,  and  to  which  the  Standby  Service 
Reservation  Fees  apply.    The  Company  will  not  be  obligated  to  supply  Standby  Service  to  back-up  a 
Customer s generator at a level in excess of the Standby capacity for which Customer has contracted.  This 
restriction  in  no  way  limits  the  amount  of  load  for  which  a  Customer  may  require  service  from  the 
Company.  Company will require Customer to contract for additional Standby Generation capacity if the 
Customer exceeds the contract amount in any Month applicable to the following full Month of service. 
Customer will annually furnish documentation to Company confirming the maximum capacity and 
reliability  of  the  power  source  for  which  Customer  requires  Standby  Service.  The  Company  and  the 
Customer  will  review  the  actual  output  and  performance  of  the  power  source  relative  to  the  capacity 
nominated  for  Standby  Service  in  the  Agreement.    If  this  review  shows  a  significant  and  consistent 
shortfall  between  the  power  source s  actual  performance  and  the  nominated  capacity  due  to  factors 
reasonably within the Customer s control, the Company will notify the Customer of its intent to refuse to 
provide Standby Service.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Customer may agree to reduce the Standby Service nomination in 
its Agreement or to take such action as necessary to operate the power source at or reasonably near the 
nominated Standby Service capacity.  If the Customer s power source does not operate at or reasonably 
near that level during the twelve (12) months immediately following the Company s notice, the Company 
may  refuse  to  provide  Standby  Service  until  such  time  as  the  Customer  agrees  to  reduce  its  Standby 
Service nomination or provide the Company with documentation demonstrating the power source s actual 
performance at or reasonably near the nominated Standby Service capacity for a trial period of three (3) 
consecutive Months. 
Customer will always be permitted to implement demand side load reductions or use alternative 
generation capacity when necessary, due to full or partial outage of the Customer s generator, instead of 
using Standby Service from the Company. 
Customer shall be liable for all damages allowed by law to the extent caused by Customer s use of 
Standby Service in excess of contracted Standby capacity. 
 
PRIMARY/SECONDARY CONVERSIONS 
Service  under  any  Primary  Voltage  is  not  an  option  for  Secondary  Voltage  Customers,  nor  is 
service  under  Secondary  Voltage  an  option  for  Primary  Voltage  Customers.  Only  in  the  limited 
circumstance that a Customer receiving Primary Service has been approved to receive Secondary Service 
through  an  approved  Transportation  Electrification  Plan  will  a  customer  receiving  Primary  Service  be 
eligible to receive Secondary Service. No Primary Voltage Customer may receive Secondary Service until 
it has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that it complies with and has met the applicable 
standards set forth in all Commission and Company Rules and Regulations. 
 
If a Customer is metered at the primary voltage level and requests service on a Secondary Voltage 
rate, the following must take place before Customer will be eligible for secondary service. 
Primary  metering  must  be  physically  removed,  and  appropriate  Secondary  Voltage 
metering equipment shall be installed at Customer s expense.  The meter(s) and instrument 
transformers are furnished and installed at Company expense. 
Company  ownership  of  all  facilities,  including  transformers,  on  the  supply  side  of  the 
secondary  meter  must  be  obtained  at  no  cost  to  the  Company.    Under  the  Distribution 
Extension  Policy  these  facilities  would  have  been  included  in  the  Distribution  Line 
Extension  cost  if  secondary  service  had  been  provided.    If  Customer  facilities were not 
originally purchased by the Company or under the Company s specifications, appropriate 
facilities  will  be  provided  by  Company  at  Customer  expense.  Removal  of  existing 
Customer-owned facilities presently in place to accommodate new Company-owned and 
installed facilities must be accomplished at Customer expense.

If service at Primary Voltage was established within the previous five (5) Year period, and 
a Construction Allowance for primary service was awarded to Customer from Company, 
Customer  will be required to pay to the Company any additional Construction Payment 
which would have been required if service had been established at the Secondary Voltage 
level and a Construction Allowance for the Secondary rate may be applicable towards such 
Additional Construction Payment. 
 
If  a  Customer  is  metered  at  the  Primary  Voltage  level,  and  is  approved  to  receive  Secondary 
Voltage  through an  approved Transportation  Electrification  Plan,  the  following  must  take  place  before 
service will be allowed on such rate: 
There may be no intermingling between the Primary and secondary systems on property   
Secondary  service  is  to  have  a  defined  area  within  the  Customer s  site  and  must  be 
accurately and clearly notated and permanently marked. 
Customer  is  required  to  execute  a  service  agreement  for  the  secondary  service  with  the 
Company. 
Only the load that is approved through the Company s Transportation Electrification Plan 
is to be connected to the Customer s secondary service. Any other load requests must be 
served through the customer s primary service. 
If  Customer  is  found  to  not  be  in  compliance  with  either  the  service  agreement  or  the 
Company s tariff or standards, Customer s secondary service will be disconnected and may 
not be reconnected until the reason for noncompliance is addressed to the satisfaction of 
the  Company.  If  Customer  fails  to  address  the  reason  for  noncompliance  within  the 
timeframe communicated to the Customer, the Company will remove all equipment related 
to the Customer s secondary service at the expense of the Customer. Consideration of the 
Customer s  reimbursement  to  the  Company  of  Construction  Allowance  and Company s 
investment towards the EV Supply Infrastructure will be made on a case by case basis.  
 
If  a  Customer  is  metered  at  the  Secondary  Voltage  level,  and  requests  service  applicable  for 
Primary Voltage, the following must take place before service will be allowed on such rate. 
Secondary  Voltage  metering  must  be  physically  removed,  and  the  appropriate  primary 
metering equipment except for the meter and instrument transformers, must be installed at 
Customer s expense.  Meter(s) and instrument transformers are furnished and installed at 
Company expense.  Customer may purchase from Company all facilities on the load side 
of  the  primary  meter  at  a  mutually  agreed  upon  price.    The  Customer  assumes 
responsibility for all improvements and maintenance of the load side facilities. 
Customer ownership of and responsibility for all facilities on the load side of the primary 
meter must be accomplished at Customer s expense. 
If  secondary service was established within the previous five 
(5)  Year  period,  consideration  of  any  differences  between 
secondary  and  primary  service  Construction  Allowances  will 
be made on a case-by-case basis.

the  conversion  plus  the  cost  to  retire  the  existing  fixtures  that  have  been  replaced  through  an 
Option  A  LED  Service  Option  Charge.    Once  the  new  LED  street  lights  are  operational,  the 
Customer shall pay on a Monthly basis under Schedule SL the base rate for the applicable LED 
Service size plus the Option A LED Service Option Charge. 
Municipal Customers participating in Option A shall be required to convert at least ninety 
percent (90%) of the HPS and MH cobra-head street lights existing within the municipality.  The 
Company agrees to work with each municipal Customer participating in Option A to develop an 
efficient conversion schedule that includes reasonable accommodations for the particular needs of 
participating Customers. 
CONVERSION TO LED LIGHTING PROGRAM   CUSTOMER CONTRIBUTION (OPTION 
B) 
Under Option B, the Customer shall be required to pay one hundred percent (100%) of the 
cost to convert the new LED fixtures plus the cost of retiring existing HPS and MH lamps as a 
non-refundable  contribution  in  aid  of  construction  to  be  billed  to  the  Customer  after 
commencement  of  the  conversion  project  in  90-day  intervals.    The  conversion  cost  shall  be 
calculated  using  the  labor,  materials,  and  vehicle  charges  specified  in  the  Company s  Electric 
Tariff governing Maintenance Charges for Street Lighting Service, including the reasonable and 
customary additional costs the Company incurs to accomplish the conversion including, but not 
limited to, the cost of the new fixture, traffic control, permitting fees, lodging and meals, or shall 
be based on more favorable unit pricing that may be negotiated by the Company once the scope of 
work under Option B has been determined.  When the conversion cost billed to the Customer is 
based  on  the  Company s  tariffed  maintenance  charges,  the  Company  shall  provide  a  detailed 
breakdown  of  the  cost  components  by  labor,  material  and  equipment  and,  if  requested  by  the 
Customer,  shall  provide  support  for  any  costs  incurred  beyond  those  costs  that  are  specifically 
stated in the tariff.  To the extent that any of the supporting information requested is confidential, 
such  information  shall  only  be  made  available  to  a  representative  of  the  municipality  who  is 
eligible  to  execute  and  has  executed  a  non-disclosure  agreement  under  the  Commission s 
confidentiality  Rules,  4  CCR  723-1-110-1102.    If  the  Company  is  successful  in  negotiating  a 
favorable unit price for the conversion work performed under Option B, the invoice breakdown 
will be limited to the conversion cost per light by lighting type.  Once the new LED street lights 
are operational, the Customer shall pay on a Monthly basis under Schedule SL the base rate for the 
applicable LED Service size plus the Option B LED Service Option Charge.

MAINTENANCE CHARGES FOR STREET LIGHTING SERVICE   CONT D 
Distribution Pole Attached Street Light O&M Service, the Company will remove any Customer-owned 
Street Lighting Facilities attached to Company-owned distribution poles at Customer s expense (which 
shall be the Company s actual costs), in a manner agreed upon by the Customer and the Company; (2) that 
the Customer or any third party at the request of the Customer will not, among other things, access, climb, 
or otherwise use the Company s distribution pole in relation to the Customer-owned street light(s), unless 
specifically authorized by the Company; and (3) any other terms and conditions that may be agreed to by 
Customer and Company. 
 
STREET LIGHTING EXTENSION POLICY 
 
For Street Lighting Service under Schedules SL, SSL, and SLU, Company Lighting Facilities will 
be installed when requested and authorized by  Customer in accordance with the provisions herein and 
connected to the Company s distribution system as part of a Distribution Line Extension as set forth in the 
Company s Distribution Extension Policy.  The installed costs for Company Lighting Equipment, less the 
Lighting Equipment portion of the Schedule SL, SSL, and SLU Construction Allowance shall be paid by 
the  Customer  to  Company  as a non-refundable Construction Payment.   For all Street Lighting  Service 
under Schedules SL, SSL, SLU, COL, and ESL, Company shall include a proportionate amount of the 
Distribution  Line  Extension  Costs  for  the  Street  Lighting  Service.    Construction  Allowance  for  the 
Distribution  System  Portion  and  Customer  Construction  Payment  requirements  for  all  street  lighting 
services rate schedules will be determined in accordance with the Distribution Extension Policy and the 
Construction Allowance amount included as part of the Extension Policy.  Company Lighting Facilities 
utilized exclusively for street lighting, including overhead or underground conductors, will not be included 
in calculating any possible Refunds of Customer Construction Payments under the Distribution Extension 
Policy unless additional lighting units are added during the Open Extension Period. 
 
In situations where the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) installs street lighting as a 
part of a state highway project, under Schedule COL, CDOT shall provide and install in compliance with 
the  Company s  Electric  Installation  Standards,  own,  operate  and  maintain  the  street  lights,  except  for 
routine  maintenance  and  Company  shall  apply  up  to  the  Distribution  Portion  of  the  Construction 
Allowance for Schedule COL towards the Distribution Line Extension that supplies power and energy to 
the  street  lights.    The  Company  shall  install  Distribution  Line  Extension  facilities  up  to  the  Point  of 
Delivery, or as otherwise determined by the Company and the Customer, which in most cases shall be the 
load  side  lugs  of  a  Company-owned  transformer,  or  a  Customer-owned  junction  or  splice  box.    The 
Company shall complete the connection to its distribution system.  Either directly after the installation of 
the street lights by CDOT or sometime thereafter, including instances where the street lights are located in 
an  unincorporated  area  and  such  area  becomes  incorporated  by  a  municipality,  CDOT  may  transfer 
ownership of the streets lights to the municipality.  Once the municipality owns the lights and desires to 
retain the street lights, the municipality may elect to receive street lighting service from the Company 
under either Schedule COL or Schedule ESL.  The municipal Customer shall 
own,  operate  and  maintain  the  street  lights,  except  for  routine  maintenance 
under Schedule COL.  In the event the municipal Customer elects to receive 
service under Schedule SL for the street lights, the municipality shall sell and 
the Company shall purchase the street light facilities at the Lighting Portion of 
the  Construction  Allowance  for  Schedule  SL.    After  transfer,  the  Company 
shall own, operate and maintain the Company s Lighting Facilities, including 
routine and non-routine maintenance under Schedule SL.

ATTACHMENT TO STREET LIGHTING POLES 
 
No posters, banners, placards, radio or television aerials, telecommunications equipment, cameras 
or other objects will be attached to street light or traffic signal poles of the Company, except as expressly 
provided under this Electric Tariff or other agreement between the Customer and the Company.  To the 
extent such an agreement has a direct and express conflict between it and the language of this Tariff Sheet, 
the terms of such agreement shall control.   
 
A  Customer  shall  be  allowed  to  use  the  Company's  street  lighting  or  traffic  signal  poles  for 
legitimate  police  and  traffic  control purposes under the terms and conditions of this Electric Tariff, or 
other applicable agreements between the Customer and the Company.  A Customer shall be allowed to 
attach banners and other ornamental attachments to Company's street lighting or traffic signal poles under 
the terms and conditions set forth in this Electric Tariff and any agreements between such Customer and 
the Company. 
 
Prior to any attachments being placed on the Company s street light or traffic signal poles, the 
Customer shall submit a written request that identifies the street lights and/or traffic signals it wishes to 
utilize  and,  to  the  extent  available,  provide  details  on  the  size,  type,  material  and  all  other  aspects  of 
specific  attachments  requested  including  documentation  of  compliance  with  the  Company s  Electric 
Installation Standards.  The Company shall review the request to ensure the proposed attachment meets 
the  Company s  Standards,  or,  if  the  Customer  does  not  provide  specific  details  of  the  proposed 
attachment(s),  provide  general  attachment  guidelines  that  the  Customer  shall  follow.    In  addition,  the 
Company may complete a pole integrity inspection.  All use of Company s street light or traffic signal 
poles shall be at the Customer s own risk and the Company shall not be responsible for any harm, claim or 
damage arising out of such use. 
In the event the Company denies an attachment due to the failure of the pole integrity inspection, 
the Company may repair or replace the street light or traffic signal pole at the Customer s request and 
expense. 
 
No attachments shall be allowed, and attachments may be removed, if the Company determines in 
good faith that the Customer s use of specific street lighting or traffic signal lighting poles creates a safety 
hazard or interferes with the Company's use of its distribution system. 
 
The Customer shall pay the Company to repair damage to any pole, permitted by this provision, 
which arises out of, or results from, the installation, maintenance or removal of any attachment from any 
pole.  The Customer shall promptly report to the Company, in writing, the occurrence of damage to any 
pole  occasioned  by  the  Customer s  use  of  the  poles  as  outlined  herein,  or  otherwise  observed  by  the 
Customer.  The Customer shall not be required to remove its existing signs, equipment or facilities, in 
each case that are used for legitimate police and traffic purposes only, from street lighting or traffic signal 
lighting  poles,  unless  the  Company  determines in good faith after consultation with the Customer that 
attachment of such specific signs, equipment or facilities on the pole(s) creates a safety hazard or interferes 
with  the  Company's  use  of  its  distribution  system.    Except  in  the  event  of  an  emergency,  where  the 
Company may immediately remove the attachment, if the Customer fails to remove the equipment or  
facilities,  the  Company  may  perform  the  removal  of  the  attachment  at  the 
Customer s expense.

Light  load  shall  be  taken  as  approximately  five  percent  (5%)  to  ten  percent  (10%)  of  rated 
capacity and heavy load as sixty percent (60%) to one hundred percent (100%) of rated capacity.  No 
meter that registers consumption of energy with no-load on the meter will be placed in service or allowed 
to remain in service in such  condition.   A  Watt-Hour meter  will be  considered to register on  no-load 
when, with all load wires disconnected, the moving element makes one (1) complete revolution in ten 
(10) minutes or less.

OTHER METER TESTS AND ENERGY ADJUSTMENTS 
 
The Company, at any time, may test any of its meters.  Upon written request of a Customer, the 
Company will test the accuracy of the service meter installed at Customer s premises free of charge if 
said meter has not been tested within the twelve (12) month period just prior to such request.  Any meter 
so tested will be considered accurate if it meets the service meter accuracy requirements of Rule 3302.   
 
If any meter so tested is found to be running fast in excess of error tolerance levels allowed under 
Rule  3302, the  Company  shall  refund  to  the Customer  one-half  of  the  weighted  average  error  for  the 
period dating from the discovery of the meter error back to the previous meter test, with such period not 
to exceed twenty-four (24) Months.  As used in this subparagraph, "weighted average error" means the 
arithmetic average of the percent error at light load and at heavy load giving the heavy load error a weight 
of four and the light load error a weight of one.  
 
If any meter so tested is found to be running slow in excess of error tolerance levels allowed under 
Rule 3302, the Company may collect from the Customer one-half of the weighted average error for the 
period dating from the discovery of the meter error back to the previous meter test, with such period not 
to exceed six (6) Months.  As used in this subparagraph, "weighted average error" means the arithmetic 
average of the percent error at light load and at heavy load giving the heavy load error a weight of four 
and the light load error a weight of one.

BILLING FOR ERRORS   Cont d 
 
An applicant who was previously a Customer of the Company and has left the Company's electric 
system owing any amount for utility services and, subsequent thereto, desires to return to the Company's 
system shall not be entitled to receive utility service until all past due amounts are satisfied in full.  In the 
event that any such Customer is found to be currently receiving utility service, any past due amounts will 
be transferred to the Customer s then active account(s). 
 
VOLTAGE 
Standard Voltage 
The  Company's  standard  nominal  voltages  for  its  secondary  voltage  distribution 
 
systems  are  120  volts,  single-phase,  two-wire  by  exception  only;  120/240  volt,  single-
phase,  three-wire;  120/240 volt, three-phase,  four-wire ; and where  available, 120/208 
volt, three-phase, four-wire; 120/240 volt, three-phase, four-wire or 277/480 volt, three-
phase, four-wire. 
 
Standard  voltages  at  240  volts,  single-phase,  two-wire;  240  volt,  three-phase, 
three-wire; 208 volt, three-phase three-wire are limited to existing service locations as of 
January  1,  2017,  after  which  the  Company  will  not  provide  service  at  these  service 
voltages.  
Permissible Voltage Variation 
 
The  Company  will  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  maintain  the  aforesaid 
voltages,  as  measured  at  Company's  service  terminals,  so  that  for  lighting  service 
variations of more than five percent (5%) above or below such standards will not occur 
and  for  power  service  variations  of  more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  above  or  below  such 
standards will not occur at any time when service is furnished. 
 
The foregoing limits are based on constant load consuming devices or gradual load 
changes and not on fluctuating loads.  Variations in voltage in excess of those specified 
herein caused by the operation of apparatus on the Customer s premises which necessarily 
require  large  inrush  of  current  such  as  produced  by  motors  during  starting,  cold 
incandescent  lamp  filaments,  X-ray  machines,  etc.,  by  action  of  the  elements,  by 
unavoidable fluctuations of short duration due to necessary station or line operations, etc., 
will not be considered as a violation of this section.

SERVICE LATERAL EXTENSION AND DISTRIBUTION LINE EXTENSION POLICY 
The  provisions  of  this  policy  are  subject  to  the  applicable  Rules  of  the  Commission  and  to 
 
 
These Rules and Regulations set forth the Service Lateral Extension and Distribution System Line 
Extension Policy  of the  Company in all territory served  by Company to  Grandfathered Applicants, as 
defined in the Company s Distribution Extension Policy, prior to October 1, 2019. 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Company's Rules and Regulations on file with the Commission. 
 
When one (1) or more Applicants request overhead or underground electric service at premises 
not connected to the Company's distribution system or request an increase in service to premises already 
connected  where  such  increase  necessitates  additional  investment,  Company,  after  consideration  of 
Applicant's  electric  requirements,  will  designate  the  service  requested  as  Permanent,  Indeterminate,  or 
Temporary in accordance with the definitions hereinafter set forth under Line Extension Plans A, B and 
C, respectively, and will construct the extension with reasonable promptness in accordance with the terms 
of the plan or plans applicable. 
 
The determination of facility type and routing will be made by Company to be consistent with the 
characteristics of the territory in which service is to be rendered and the nature of Company's existing 
facilities in the area. 
 
In all cases, the facilities provided will be constructed by the Company or its designated agent in 
accordance with the Company's construction specifications, standards and procedures, and shall be, at all 
times, the property of the Company on the electric supply side of the Point of Delivery.  Distribution Line 
Extension Contracts and Service Lateral Extension Contracts will be based upon Company's estimate of 
the cost of constructing and installing the facilities necessary to adequately supply the service requested 
by Applicant.  Such cost will include the cost of all materials, labor, rights-of-way, trench and backfill, 
environmental  remediation,  permitting,  tree  trimming,  etc.,  together  with  all  incidental  and  overhead 
expenses connected therewith.  Where special items, not incorporated in said specifications, are required 
to meet construction conditions, including but not limited to frost conditions, rock conditions etc., the cost 
thereof will also be included, either in the initial estimate or at a time subsequent thereafter as conditions 
may change as determined by Company.

situated  load  where  the  residential  or  commercial  Customer s  load  requirements  are  increased 
substantially over normal load per square foot ratios such that the Company is required to install 
additional capacity over that which it would normally provide.  The High Density Load guidelines 
for Residential Customers will be based on the most recent Residential Energy Use Survey using 
average  Kilowatt-Hours  (kWh)  per  square  foot  and  a  seventy-five  percent  (75%)  Load  Factor 
using Peak Design to determine what loads are substantially over the normal load per square foot, 
thereby requiring additional capacity.

Incremental  Service  Charge  is  a  Monthly  charge  to  cover  the  Company s  cost  of 
insurance, replacement (or cost of removal), license and fees, taxes, operation and maintenance 
and  appropriate  allocable  administrative  and  general  expenses  of  such  excess  distribution 
facilities. The Monthly Incremental Service Charge shall be seven and three tenths percent (7.3%) 
times  the  cost  for  such  facilities  divided  by  twelve  (12).  This  charge  is  subject  to  review  and 
appropriate revision by filing of a revised Incremental Service Charge rate by the Company with 
the  Commission  within  thirty  (30)  days  or  within  such  period  of  time  as  ordered  by  the 
Commission, following a final decision in a Company Phase II rate proceeding.

as  set  forth  in  the  Electric  Installation  Standards.    Service  Lateral  provides  electric  service  for 
Customer's  exclusive  use.    The  responsibility  for  installation,  ownership,  operation  and 
maintenance of the service lateral is set forth in the Electric Installation Standards.  
Subsequent Extension 
A subsequent extension shall be additional construction involving Primary Voltage lines.  
However,  if  Primary  Voltage  is  used  as  a  lateral  to  serve  a  single  Applicant,  Residential, 
Commercial or Industrial Customer to prevent voltage drop, such Primary Voltage lateral shall 
not be considered a subsequent extension.  
 
In cases in which new or reinforcement construction involves adding Secondary Voltage 
Applicant(s)  to  a  preexisting  or  new  Primary  Voltage  Distribution  Line  Extension,  the 
Applicant(s)  shall  participate  in  the  Primary  and  the  Secondary  Voltage  Distribution  Line 
Extensions as separate extensions.  If the secondary Distribution Line Extension is completed at 
the same time as the Primary Voltage Distribution Line Extension, then both extensions shall have 
the same Open Extension Period.  However, if the secondary Distribution Line Extension is a part 
of  a  preexisting  Primary  Voltage  Distribution  Line  Extension,  the  secondary  Distribution  Line 
Extension becomes a subsequent extension after the end of the Primary Voltage Distribution Line 
Extension Open Extension Period has expired.

Uneconomic Extension section herein. 
 
For  electric  service  of  a  permanent  character,  the  Company  will  install  at  its  expense, 
necessary  overhead  or  underground  electric  Distribution  Line  Extension  facilities  equivalent  in 
cost  up  to  the  gross  embedded  distribution  plant  investment  per  Customer  or  per  Kilowatt 
Demand as a Construction Allowance.  The remainder  of the Construction Cost of  Distribution 
Facilities  shall  be  paid  by  the  Applicant  as  a  Construction  Payment.  The  Distribution  Line 
Extension  Construction  Allowance  for  service  on  rate  schedules  that  do  not  have  a  separate 
Demand charge component shall be derived as the gross, embedded, distribution plant investment 
per  Customer.  The  Distribution  Line  Extension  Construction  Allowance  for  service  on  rate 
schedules that have a separate Demand charge component shall be the product of the Company's 
estimate of the Applicant's Demand times the derived gross embedded Demand investment per 
Kilowatt (kW).  The Distribution Line Portion of the Construction Allowance shall be derived as 
the gross, embedded, Customer -related, distribution plant investment per Customer.  The Service 
Lateral Extension Construction Allowance shall be derived as the gross, embedded, lateral plant 
investment  per  Customer.    The  Construction  Allowances  are  listed  on  the  sheet  entitled

In situations involving Applicant(s) for Network Service, Applicant shall be required to 
pay Company for all Construction Costs associated with the preferred feeder as a Construction 
Payment.  The Construction Payment may be reduced by an award of Construction Allowance for 
Permanent  Service.  Electric  service  provided  through  a  network  shall  be  eligible  for  one  (1) 
Construction Allowance, consistent with the requirements for Permanent Service.  The Company 
shall include  and  Applicant shall pay Company  as  a non-refundable Construction Payment the 
estimated  Construction  Cost  for  the  alternate  feeder(s)  under  the  Distribution  Line  Extension 
Agreement.  Network service is available in areas designated by Company to be served using an 
electric network system. 
 
Applicant  or  Applicants  shall  be  required  to  pay  prior  to  construction  as  part  of  the 
Extension Agreement or Construction Agreement to the Company as a Construction Payment all 
estimated costs for electric Distribution Line Extension facilities necessary to serve Applicant or 
Applicants.    Except  for  the  Construction  Payment  made  for  alternate  feeders,  the  Construction 
Payment may be reduced by an award of Construction Allowance or Refund during a ten (10) 
Year period commencing with the Extension Completion Date.  At the end of the said ten (10) 
Year period any remaining Construction Payment becomes non-refundable. 
 
Applicant or Applicants that request a Service Lateral be installed by Company shall be 
required to pay the Company as a non-refundable Construction Payment all estimated costs for the 
Service Lateral Extension in excess of the Service Lateral Portion of the Construction Allowance.  
Payment shall be made by the Applicant prior to installation. 
 
The  Construction  Allowance  for  the  Distribution  Portion  will  be  credited  only  when 
service  is  physically  connected  and  a  permanent  service  meter  is  set;  however,  Construction 
Allowances  will be awarded  at time of execution of the  Extension  Agreement or Construction 
Agreement, if Company estimates Permanent Service will be physically connected within one (1) 
Year  from  the  execution  date  of  the  Extension  Agreement  or  Construction  Agreement.  
Alternatively, for land development, Construction Allowances will be applied to the Construction 
Payment  after  the  Company  receives:  (a)  an  executed  Extension  Agreement  or  Construction 
Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Applicant  submits  to  the  Company  an  approved  final  plat  of  the 
development  or  subdivision  that  is  approved  by  the  governmental  entity  having  jurisdiction  as 
applicable.

The  above  allowances  are  subject  to  review  and  appropriate  revision  by  filing  of  new 
Construction Allowances with the Commission within thirty (30) days following a final decision 
in  a  Company  cost  allocation  and  rate  design  proceeding,  based  on  the  appropriate  gross 
distribution investment amounts included in that proceeding. 
 
Regarding Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations, beginning with the effective date of 
this Electric Tariff and ending December 31, 2019, Applicant or Applicants shall be required to 
pay to Company as a Construction Payment all estimated costs for necessary electric Distribution 
Line Extension and Service Lateral Extension.  Regarding additional facilities necessary to serve 
the EV Charging portion of the EV Charging Station based on the added load in Kilowatts, said 
Construction Payment may be reduced by an award of Construction Allowance in part or in its 
entirety, in twenty percent (20%) increments, up to the level of the Construction Allowance that 
would be awarded for such facility for a period of five (5) Years after the Extension Completion 
Date.   After said  five (5) Year  period  has expired, Construction Allowance shall no longer be 
available.  All non-fueling usage of the EV Charging Station shall be determined by the Company 
as Permanent, Indeterminate, or Temporary Service as applicable. 
 
The Company may opt to offer Applicant(s) an advance for the Construction Payment by 
entering into a Construction Payment Agreement.  Under this option, the Company shall require 
the Applicant(s) to make monthly installment payments that will cover the Company's costs of 
such advance.  The Construction Payment Agreement allows the Applicant to have advanced a 
minimum of $500.00 and thereafter in increments of $100.00 for a one (1), three (3), five (5) or 
ten  (10)  Year  term.    The  maximum  amount  to  be  advanced  under  the  Construction  Payment 
Agreement  will  be  $5,000  for  Residential  and  $10,000  for  Commercial  Customers.    At  the 
Company's  discretion,  additional  amounts  may  be  advanced  with  Company  written  approval, 
where Applicant's financial condition is determined by the Company to be satisfactory.  Applicant 
retains  the  option  to  buy  down  any  portion  or  all  of  the  remaining  Construction  Payment 
Agreement balance at any time.

owner or Customer without the advanced written approval of the Company.  The Company shall 
not be required to approve any such assignment or transfer unless, in the Company's opinion, the 
prospective assignee or transferee is financially qualified to assume the responsibilities thereunder 
and  provides  the  Company  with  all  documentation  required  by  the  Company  reflecting  the 
assignee or transferee's agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions thereof.  In the event 
no such transfer or assignment is approved by the Company, the continuation of electric service at 
the  subject  location  to  any  subsequent  property  owner  or  Customer  shall  be  conditioned  upon 
payment in full having been received by the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of any 
previous Construction Payment Agreement or original Service Lateral Extension and Distribution

For electric service of an indeterminate character, involving real estate subdivisions and 
 
development of land for sale wherein Refunds are not possible and where Applicant and Company 
execute a Construction Agreement, Applicant or Applicants shall be required to advance payment 
to  Company  as  a  nonrefundable  Construction  Payment  the  entire  estimated  cost  for  necessary 
overhead  or  underground  electric  Distribution  Line  Extension  facilities,  and  the  Company  will

PLAN C   TEMPORARY SERVICE 
 
Plan C is applicable to overhead or underground electric Distribution Line Extensions and 
Service Lateral Extensions where service is of a known temporary nature.  If temporary service is 
continued  for  more  than  eighteen  (18)  months  following  the  Extension  Completion  Date  the 
nature  of  such  continued  service  will  be  evaluated  and,  if  appropriate,  reclassified  as 
Indeterminate or Permanent Service. 
 
For electric service of a temporary character, Applicant or Applicants shall be required to 
pay to Company as a Construction Payment an amount equal to the estimated cost of installing 
and  removing  all  necessary  overhead  or  underground  electric  Distribution  Line  Extension  and 
Service Lateral Extension facilities less the estimated salvage value. 
 
Distribution  Line  Extensions  requiring  Customer  Construction  Payments  under  an 
Extension Agreement are subject to Refunds during the ten (10) Year period commencing with 
the Extension Completion Date. Such Refunds will be made in conformance with the provisions 
applicable  to  Refunds  under  the  appropriate  plan  under  which  the  extension  is  classified.    No 
Refunds will be made after the ten (10) Year period following the Extension Completion Date and 
any remaining unrefunded Customer Construction Payment for Distribution Line Extension shall 
no longer subject to Refund for any reason.  In no case shall Refunds be made which exceed in 
total the total amount of Construction Payment made by any Customer.  In no event shall any 
Customer  who  has  terminated  service  be  eligible  for  any  Refund  after  such  termination.   
However, the Company  may  close open Distribution  Line Extensions before the ten (10) Year 
refund period has expired in instances where the Company determines that no potential Refunds 
are possible such that there are no potential new Customers to be served by the extension.

CALCULATION AND PAYMENTS OF REFUNDS 
 
PLAN A   PERMANENT SERVICE 
 
Construction  Payments  made  under  a  Plan  A  Distribution  Line  Extension  under  an 
Extension Agreement shall be subject to Refund without interest during the ten (10) Year period 
following the Extension Completion Date as follows: 
For each additional Permanent Service Customer connected directly to an electric 
Distribution  Line  Extension  upon  which  there  is  unrefunded  Construction  Payment 
remaining, Company will recalculate the extension considering the costs of any additional 
transformation  and  secondary  facilities  and  considering  the  Construction  Allowance 
provided  to  such  additional  Customer  or  Customers,  as  well  as  appropriate  sharing  of 
Construction  Payment  requirements  among  all  Customers  to  be  served  by  the  electric 
Distribution Line Extension. 
Construction  Payments  or  executed  Construction  Payment  Agreements  that  are 
required of each additional Customers or Customers under an Extension Agreement must 
be  made  prior  to  connection  of  electric  Service  Laterals.    Refunds  of  Customer 
Construction  Payments  or  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  Construction  Payment 
Agreement amounts, where appropriate, will be calculated and paid once each Year during 
the Open Extension Period and at a time determined by Company. 
Each  Customer  having  made  a  Construction  Payment  under  an  Extension 
Agreement will receive as a Refund the amount necessary, if any, to adjust Customer s 
Construction  Payment  to  the  proper  level  considering  the  additional  Customers  served 
from the extension and considering the Construction Allowance in effect, if any, from a 
Subsequent  Extension.    Any  additional  construction  involving  adding  Primary  Voltage 
lines shall be determined as set forth in the Subsequent Extension definition. 
In the case of a Subsequent Extension made from a Distribution Line Extension on 
which  there  are  remaining  unrefunded  Customer  Construction  Payments  and  where  the 
initial calculated Construction Allowance from Customers on said Subsequent Extension 
would  exceed  the  Construction  Costs  for  such  extension,  the  excess  Construction 
Allowance  will  be  credited  to  the  extension  on  which  there  is  remaining  unrefunded 
Customer Construction Payments and become a part of the annual Refunds made thereon. 
Additional  Customers  of  an  Indeterminate  Service  or  Temporary  Service 
classification  can  be  served  from  a  Plan  A  extension  on  which  unrefunded  Customer 
Construction  Payments  remain  only  after  first  allocating  a  portion  of  the  Construction 
Costs  of  the  Plan  A  extension  on  a  permanent  basis  to  such  Indeterminate  Service  or 
Temporary Service Customers.

PLAN A   PERMANENT SERVICE   Cont d 
The portion of Customer Construction Payments required from such Indeterminate 
Service  or  Temporary  Service  Customers  resulting  from  said  allocation  will 
correspondingly  reduce  the  responsibility  of  Customers  on  the  Plan  A  extension  and 
become a part of the annual Refund made to such Customers. 
 
PLAN B   INDETERMINATE SERVICE 
Customers  of  a  Permanent  Service,  Indeterminate  Service  or  Temporary  Service 
 
classification  can  be  served  from  a  Plan  B  extension  on  which  Construction  Payments  remain 
under an Extension Agreement only after first allocating a portion of the Construction Costs of the 
Plan B extension on a permanent basis to such Permanent, Indeterminate or Temporary service 
Customers.    The  portion  of  Customer  Construction  Payments  required  from  the  Permanent  or 
Temporary service Customers resulting from said allocation will then become a part of an annual 
Refund as determined by Company to be made to Customers on the Plan B extension, and would 
be in addition to the amount of Refund based on Construction Allowance being made otherwise. 
 
An  evaluation  may  be  made  of  Indeterminate  Service  Customers  within  the  Open 
Extension  Period  following  completion  of  construction  under  which  the  Customers  may  be 
appropriately reclassified as Permanent Service or Temporary Service  Customers as conditions 
warrant.

PLAN B   INDETERMINATE SERVICE   Cont d 
 
Construction Payments made under a Plan B Distribution Line Extension for real estate or 
land development under an Extension Agreement shall be reclassified as Permanent subject to a 
Construction Allowance payment without interest during the ten (10) Year period following the 
Extension Completion Date as follows: at the end of each Year for up to ten (10) Years following 
the Extension Completion Date  a Construction Allowance payment will be made based on the 
additional Construction Allowances for additional permanent service Customers served from the 
extension after first increasing the original extension costs and Customer payment requirements to 
reflect additional Customers added to the extension. 
 
PLAN C   TEMPORARY SERVICE 
No  Refund  of  Construction  Payments  for  Temporary  Service  will  be  made  unless  the 
 
subject  extension  is  subdivided  by  the  addition  of  Permanent  Service  or  Indeterminate  Service 
Customers  or  in  the  event  that  the  Temporary  Service  Customer  is  reclassified  as  an 
Indeterminate Service Customer as follows: 
Customers of a Permanent Service or Indeterminate Service classification can be 
served from a Plan C  extension only  after first allocating  a portion of the Construction 
Costs  of  the  Plan  C  extension  on  a  permanent  basis  to  such  Permanent  Service  or 
Indeterminate  Service  Customers.    The  portion  of  Customer  Construction  Payments 
required from said Permanent Service or Indeterminate Service Customers resulting from 
said allocation will be Refunded to Customers on the Plan C extension. 
A  Temporary  Service  Customer  continuing  to  require  service  after  an  eighteen 
(18)  month  period  will  be  subject  to  reevaluation  as  to  the  nature  of  service.    If 
appropriate,  such  Customer  and  the  associated  construction  will  be  reclassified  as 
Indeterminate  or  Permanent  Service  with  costs  and  Refund  considerations  being 
reevaluated as Indeterminate or Permanent Service based on the original extension costs 
and completion dates. In no event shall the total amount refunded to any Customer exceed 
the total Construction Payment made by that Customer.

PHOTOVOLTAIC COST COMPARISON 
Bona Fide Applicants, when requesting of the Company a cost estimate of a Distribution Line 
Extension  and  Service  Lateral  Extension,  shall  receive  a  photovoltaic  system  cost  comparison,  upon 
meeting the following conditions; providing the Company with load data (estimated Monthly Kilowatt-
Hour usage) as requested by the Company to conduct the comparison, the Applicant's peak Demand is 
estimated  to  be  less  than  twenty-five  (25)  kW,  and  meeting  the  requirements  of  paragraph  3  of  this 
section. 
In performing the comparison analysis, the Company will consider Distribution Line Extension 
distance,  overhead/underground  construction,  terrain,  other  variable  Construction  Costs,  and  the 
probability of additions to the Distribution Line Extension within the life of the Open Extension Period. 
For Applicants whose ratio of estimated Monthly Kilowatt-Hour usage divided by Distribution 
Line Extension mileage is less than or equal to one thousand (1,000), (i.e. kWh/Mileage is <= 1,000), the 
Company will provide the photovoltaic system cost comparison at no cost to the Applicant.  
 
THREE-PHASE CONSIDERATIONS 
In all cases where Customers requiring three-phase service are served or to be served at locations 
such that the distribution facilities required would in part be provided by facilities also serving single-
phase service, all Distribution Line Extension and Service Lateral Extension Construction Costs as well 
as Customer Construction Payment requirements and Refunds shall be considered as though there were 
separate extensions for each type of service.  In calculating the requirements for each type of service, the 
costs of the single-phase extension will be based on the total requirements for such service and the cost of 
the three-phase extension will include only the difference for providing such service, regardless of which 
requirement  came  first.    A  proportionate  share  of  each  three-phase  Customer's  electric  load  and 
Construction Allowance where such Customer is served in part from a single-phase extension shall be 
considered in conjunction with other single-phase Customers served from the extension in the calculation 
of all Construction Payment and Refund considerations of the single-phase extension.

THREE-PHASE CONSIDERATIONS   Cont d 
The  remaining  proportionate  share  of  any  such  three-phase  Customer's  electric  load  and 
Construction  Allowance  shall  be  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  separate  three-phase  Distribution 
Extension costs, Customer Construction Payments and refunds.  In making the above determination all 
single-phase Customers shall be considered as being on the same extension regardless of whether such 
Customers are physically connected to the same phase.  In all cases for each Distribution Line Extension, 
the earliest construction completion date of the facilities constructed will be used in the determination of 
Refund eligibility. 
 
REINFORCEMENTS 
Where electric distribution system reinforcement is required for serving an existing Customer s 
electric service from Company, Company shall make such reinforcement of the distribution system as 
follows:  for  residential  or  small  commercial  Customer  that  receives  service  under  a  rate  schedule  in 
which the Distribution Portion of the Construction Allowance is not based on Kilowatt Demand, relating 
to  the  Customer's  total  load  requirements,  other  than  a  High  Density  Load,  Company  will  make  such 
reinforcements at its expense. 
For all Customers that receive service under a rate schedule in which the Distribution Portion of 
the  Construction  Allowance  is  based  on  Kilowatt  Demand,  other  than  a  High  Density  Load,  such 
reinforcement  shall  be  a  Distribution  Line  Extension  where  the  Construction  Cost  shall  include  the 
Company s cost to reinforce the system necessary to serve Customer s total load and the Construction 
Allowance shall be based on the difference between the Customer s current maximum Demand over the 
previous twelve (12) months and the Company s estimate of the Customer s projected total load. 
Where  electric  distribution  system  reinforcement  is  required  to  serve  a  High  Density  Load 
Customer that in whole or in part with another High Density Load Customer causes system capacity to be 
exceeded or Company s facilities to be overloaded, the Customer shall be required to pay Company the 
necessary costs for the upgrade or reinforcement needed to correct the condition. 
Where  electric  distribution  system  reinforcement  is  required  for  serving  new  Applicants  for 
electric service from Company, Company shall make such reinforcement as part of a new Distribution 
Line Extension where the Construction Cost shall include the Company s cost to reinforce the system as 
well  as  new  distribution  facilities  necessary  to  serve  Customer s  total  load  and  the  Construction 
Allowance shall be applicable to the total Construction Cost.

REINFORCEMENTS   Cont d 
For  conversion  from  single-phase  to  three-phase  service  and  all  other  classes  of  service  with 
Kilowatt Demand based Distribution Portion Construction Allowances, any required reinforcement shall 
generally recognize the construction cost, Construction Allowance for the Applicant s additional load and 
Customer  Construction  Payment  provisions  of  this  extension  policy  in  accordance  with  individual 
agreements between Applicant and Company based upon the amount, character and permanency of the 
load.  For  purposes  of  this  section  all  reinforcement  for  land  development  shall  be  considered  non-
residential and the land developer shall be responsible for reinforcement costs. 
 
CONVERSION OF OVERHEAD TO UNDERGROUND 
Customer  or  Customers  desiring  to  have  Company's  existing  overhead  facilities  presently 
providing  service  installed  underground  may  request  Company  to  make  such  changes.    If  Company 
determines that such conversion can reasonably be made, Company will make such conversion on the 
following basis:  the estimated costs of the new facilities to be installed, plus the cost of removing existing 
facilities, less salvage value, shall be paid by the Customer or Customers as a non-refundable payment. 
 
RELOCATION OF DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES 
Except  as  may  be  provided  by  law  or  in  franchise  agreements  with  municipalities,  Customers 
desiring to have Company's distribution facilities relocated, may request Company to make such changes.  
If  Company  determines  that  such  relocations  can  reasonably  be  made,  Company  will  make  such 
relocations at the Customer's expense.  Customer will be required to pay the Company for the estimated 
costs  of  the  new  facilities  to  be  installed,  plus  removal  cost  of  the  existing  facilities,  less  the  salvage 
value, as a non-refundable payment.

UNECONOMIC EXTENSIONS 
For  Uneconomic  Extensions,  the  Company  shall  require  Applicant(s)  to  pay  Company,  in 
advance, all Construction Costs.  With respect to Uneconomic Extensions, the Company may, under its 
sole discretion, investigate the possibility of allowing Applicant(s) to be served by another utility as set 
forth in the General Provisions section of this Extension Policy. 
 
APPLICABILITY LIMITATION 
 
 
The foregoing extension policy applicability is limited by the following conditions: 
The Company's estimated Construction Costs  and Applicant s Construction Payment as 
calculated for each Distribution Line or Service Lateral Extension will become void following a 
period of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the time an extension request is received by 
Company or a period of sixty (60) days following a written estimate being provided by Company, 
whichever period ends later.  If an Extension Agreement or Construction Agreement in writing is 
not fully executed before that time it will be necessary, at the Company's option, to either extend 
said  time  period  or  for  new  estimates  to  be  made  incorporating  the  then  current  Construction 
Costs and also incorporating the then effective terms and conditions of the Company's Extension 
Policy on file and in effect with the Commission. 
 
The Company shall provide Applicant a Construction Cost estimate within sixty (60) days 
after Company accepts a fully completed Application for Gas and Electric Services Form from 
Applicant,  which  includes  all  information  necessary,  as  determined  by  Company,  for  the 
Company to estimate the Construction Cost.  The Application for Gas and Electric Services Form 
is available on the Company s website referenced on the Title Sheet of this Electric Tariff.  For 
electric  service  requests  involving  large  and  or  complex  configurations,  as  determined  by  the 
Company,  the  Company  shall  provide  the  Applicant  the  estimated  time  that  it  will  require  to 
provide a Construction Cost estimate.

Company's  transmission  system  or  request  an  increase  in  service  to  premises  already  connected  where 
such  increase  necessitates  additional  investment,  Company,  after  consideration  of  applicant's  electric 
requirements, will construct the transmission extension or reinforcement with reasonable promptness in 
accordance with the terms of this policy. 
 
The determination of facility type and routing will be made by Company to be consistent with the 
characteristics of the territory in which service is to be rendered and the nature of Company's existing

Company's Rules and Regulations on file with the Commission. 
The provisions of this policy are subject to the applicable Rules of the Commission and to the 
These Rules and Regulations set forth the Distribution Extension Policy in all territory served by 
 
the Company. 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
N 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Applicant is an individual person or persons requesting electric service on or after the effective 
 
 
date of this Electric Tariff, who own the property requiring such service, including the legal entity, builder, 
 
developer, corporation, limited partnership or any person having legal authority over the property. This 
 
Distribution Extension Policy applies to Applicants that execute a Facilities Extension Agreement on or 
 
after the effective date of this Electric Tariff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grandfathered Applicants are those Residential Applicants or Commercial Applicants who request 
extensions and execute a Distribution Line Extension and/or Construction Agreement, as defined in the 
grandfathered tariff sheets, prior to the effective date of this Electric Tariff.  Unless otherwise stated in this 
Electric  Tariff,  the  distribution  extension  for  a  Grandfathered  Applicant  shall  be  governed  by  the 
grandfathered  tariff  sheets  in  place  at  the  time  its  Distribution  Line  Extension  and/or  Construction 
Agreement  was  executed.    Additional  terms  and  conditions  that  apply  to  distribution  extensions  for 
Grandfathered Applicants are set forth in the Construction Allowance and Construction Payments section 
of this Electric Tariff.   
When one (1) or more Applicants request overhead or underground electric service at premises not 
connected to the Company's distribution system or request an increase or change in service to premises 
already  connected  where  such  increase  or  change  necessitates  additional  Company  investment,  the 
Company, after consideration of Applicant's electric requirements, will designate the service requested as 
Permanent  Service,  Indeterminate  Service,  or  Temporary  Service  in  accordance  with  the  definitions 
hereinafter set forth. The provisions of this policy are applicable to extending service to both Residential 
Applicants and Commercial Applicants. 
The Company will provide Applicants with expected installation timeframes and will construct 
service  extensions  in  accordance  with  this  policy.  The  Company  shall  make  all  reasonable  efforts  to 
complete  Applicant  requests  within  such  timeframes  under  normal  circumstances  and  conditions.  The 
Company shall provide periodic status updates to the Applicant throughout the construction process. 
The determination of facility type and routing will be made by the Company consistent with the 
characteristics of the territory in which service is to be rendered and  
the nature of the Company's existing facilities in the area.

In all cases, the facilities provided will be constructed by the Company or its designated agent in 
 
 
accordance with the Company's construction specifications, Electric Extension Standards, and procedures, 
 
and shall be, at all times, the property of the Company on the electric supply side of the Point of Delivery. 
 
Agreements for service will be based upon Company's estimate of the cost of constructing and 
 
installing the facilities necessary to adequately supply the service requested by Applicant. Such cost will 
 
include  the  cost  of  all  materials,  labor,  rights-of-way,  trench  and  backfill,  environmental  remediation, 
 
permitting, tree trimming, etc., together with all incidental and overhead expenses connected therewith. 
 
 
Where special items, not incorporated in said specifications, are required to meet construction conditions, 
 
including but not limited to frost conditions, rock conditions etc., the cost thereof will also be included, 
 
either in the initial estimate or at a time subsequent thereafter as conditions may change as determined by 
 
Company. 
 
In cases where another utility has a distribution line of adequate capacity closer than existing 
 
Company facilities to Applicant's requested point of service and the application of this policy, including 
 
the  Photovoltaic  Cost  Comparison  and  Uneconomic  Extension  sections  herein,  would  result  in 
 
 
unreasonable economic hardship to Applicant(s), the Company may, under its sole discretion, enter into 
 
a temporary agreement with the neighboring utility to allow that utility to temporarily provide service to 
 
Applicant until such time as Company is able to serve Applicant.

There are four (4) separate agreements corresponding to the type of service extension(s) requested 
1)  Off-Site Distribution Line Extension Agreement. The cost responsibility of the Applicant under 
this  Agreement  will  be  based  upon  Company's  estimate  of  the  cost  of  constructing  and 
installing the facilities necessary to adequately supply the Off-Site Distribution Line Extension 
requested by Applicant, less an Off-Site Distribution Line Extension Credit.

4)  Commercial Service Lateral Agreement. The cost responsibility of the Applicant under this 
 
 
Agreement will be based upon the Company's estimate of the cost of constructing and installing 
 
the  facilities  necessary  to  adequately  supply  the  Commercial  Service  Lateral  requested  by 
Applicant, less a Construction Allowance. 
 
2)  On-Site Distribution Extension Agreement. The cost responsibility of the Applicant under this 
Agreement will be either 1) based upon standardized per lot costs of constructing and installing 
the  facilities  necessary  to  adequately  supply  service  to  single  family  and  townhome  lots 
requested by Applicant (average of sixty feet (60 ft.) or less frontage) and/or 2) based upon 
Company s  estimate  of  the  cost  of  constructing  and  installing  other  facilities  necessary  to 
adequately supply the On-Site Distribution Extension requested by Applicant (including but 
not limited to single family and townhome lots more than an average of sixty feet (60 ft.) 
frontage, non-standard load and construction requirements, and commercial facilities), less a 
Construction Allowance. 
3)  Residential  Service Lateral  Agreement.  The cost responsibility of the  Applicant under this 
Agreement will be based upon a standardized cost for the first one hundred feet (100 ft.) of the 
Residential Service Lateral and a standardized per foot cost thereafter for extensions longer 
than one hundred feet (100 ft.). 
Models  of  each  of  the  four  (4)  standard  Facilities  Extension  Agreements,  including  model 
governmental  provisions,  as  appropriate,  of  the  Off-Site  Distribution  Extension  Agreement,  On-Site 
Distribution  Agreement,  Residential  Service  Lateral  Agreement,  and  Commercial  Service  Lateral

Incremental Service Charge 
 
High Density Load 
DISTRIBUTION EXTENSION POLICY 
 
N 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A High Density Load is an indoor plant growing facility or other similarly situated load 
 
where the Residential or Commercial Customer s load requirements are increased substantially over 
 
normal load per square foot ratios such that the Company is required to install additional capacity 
 
over  that  which  it  would  normally  provide.  The  High  Density  Load  guidelines  for  Residential 
 
Applicants will be based on the most recent Residential Energy Use Survey using average Kilowatt-
 
Hours (kWh) per square foot and a seventy-five percent (75%) Load Factor using peak design to 
 
 
determine  what  loads  are  substantially  over  the  normal  load  per  square  foot,  thereby  requiring 
 
additional capacity. 
 
 
 
Incremental Service Charge is a Monthly charge to cover the Company s cost of insurance, 
 
replacement (or cost of removal), license and fees, taxes, operation and maintenance (O&M) and 
 
appropriate allocable administrative and general expenses of such excess Distribution Extension 
 
 
Facilities. The Monthly Incremental Service Charge shall be seven and three tenths percent (7.3%) 
 
times  the  cost  for  such  facilities  divided  by  twelve  (12).  This  charge  is  subject  to  review  and 
 
appropriate revision by filing of a revised Incremental Service Charge rate by the Company with 
 
the  Commission  within  ninety  (90)  days  or  within  such  period  of  time  as  ordered  by  the 
 
Commission, following a final decision in a Company Phase II rate proceeding. 
 
 
 
Indeterminate Service 
Service for overhead or underground electric Off-Site Distribution Line Extensions, On-Site 
 
Distribution Extensions, and Service Lateral Extensions for service which is of an indefinite or 
indeterminate nature, as determined by the Company, such as that required by, but not limited to (a) 
speculative commercial development of property for sale; (b) mines, quarries, sand pits, oil wells, 
certain High Density Loads, and other enterprises of more or less speculative characteristics; or (c) 
all other service to which neither Permanent Service nor Temporary Service is applicable.

number  of  Customers  in  each  customer  class. However,  a  Service  Lateral  Construction 
Allowance is not available for Customers taking service under Schedule EDR.  
The  methodology  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  On-Site  Distribution  portion  of  the 
Construction Allowance represents the allocated gross plant in-service to each customer class 
divided by the number of Customers in each customer class, or kW/Mo. demand by customer 
class. However, an On-Site Distribution Construction Allowance is not available for Customers 
taking service under Schedule EDR. The methodology is subject to review and appropriate revisions 
by filing with the Commission new Construction Allowances in the Construction Allowance by 
Customer Class and Rate Schedule section of this Electric Tariff.

On-Site Distribution Extension 
 
Applicant or Applicants shall be required to pay prior to construction as part of the On-Site 
 
Distribution  Extension  Agreement  a  non-refundable  Construction  Payment  for  Distribution 
 
Extension  Facilities  necessary  to  serve  Applicant  or  Applicants   On-Site  Distribution,  less  the 
applicable Construction Allowance. Service Laterals shall not be considered part of the Distribution 
Extension  Facilities  necessary  to  serve  an  On-Site  Distribution  Extension.  On-Site  Distribution 
Extension Construction Costs will be based upon a standardized per lot cost based on an average of 
sixty feet (60 ft.) of frontage or rear lot line dependent upon the location of the Company s facilities. 
Should  this  standardized  lot  size  not  be  applicable  given  the  nature  of  the  Extension  in  the 
Company s sole discretion, an estimated cost of the On-Site Distribution Extension will be derived 
by the Company.

Electric Vehicle Charging Stations 
For Applicants who execute a Facilities Extension Agreement after the effective date of this Electric 
Tariff,  the  Construction  Payment,  Construction  Allowance  and/or  Off-Site  Distribution  Line 
Extension Credit is dependent on the applicable Distribution Extension Facilities service requested 
(On-Site  Distribution  Extension,  Off-Site  Distribution  Line  Extension  or  Service  Lateral),  as 
determined by the Company. The Company will determine such eligibility in the same manner as 
it does for other Customers who receive service with a permanent character.  
 
For Grandfathered Applicants that have a Distribution Line Extension Agreement executed for 
Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations prior to the effective date of this Electric Tariff shall be 
required to pay to the Company as a Construction Payment all estimated costs for necessary electric 
On-Site  Distribution  Extensions,  Off-Site  Distribution  Line  Extensions,  and  Service  Lateral 
Extensions. Regarding additional facilities necessary to serve the EV charging portion of the EV 
charging station based on the added load in Kilowatts, said Construction Payment may be reduced 
by  an  award  of  Construction  Allowance  in  part  or  in  its  entirety,  in  twenty  percent  (20%) 
increments, up to the level of the Construction Allowance that would be awarded for such facility 
for a period of five (5) years after the Extension Completion Date. After said five (5) year period 
has expired, Construction Allowance shall no longer be available. All non-fueling usage of the EV 
charging station shall be determined by the Company as Permanent Service, Indeterminate Service, 
or Temporary Service as applicable.

Applicants, when requesting of the Company a cost estimate of an Off-Site Distribution

upon  meeting  the  following  conditions:  (1)  providing  the  Company  with  load  data  (estimated 
 
monthly  kWh  usage)  as  requested  by  the  Company  to  conduct  the  comparison  and  (2)  the 
 
Applicant's Monthly peak Demand is estimated to be less than twenty-five (25) kW. 
 
In performing the comparison analysis, the Company will consider Off-Site Distribution 
 
Line Extension distance, overhead/underground construction, terrain, other variable Construction 
 
Costs, and the probability of additions to the Off-Site Distribution Line Extension within ten (10) 
 
 
years of the Extension Completion Date as determined by the Company. 
 
The  Company  will  provide  the  photovoltaic  system  cost  comparison  at  no  cost  to  the 
 
 
 
 
In all cases where Applicants requiring three-phase service are served or to be served at 
 
locations  such  that  the  Distribution  Extension  Facilities  required  would  in  part  be  provided  by 
 
 
facilities also serving single-phase service, all On-Site Distribution Extension, Off-Site Distribution 
 
Line  Extension,  and  Service  Lateral  Extension  Construction  Costs,  as  well  as  Customer 
 
Construction Payment requirements, shall be considered as though there were separate extensions 
 
for each type of service. In calculating the requirements for each type of service, the costs of the 
 
single-phase extension will be based on the total requirements for such service and the cost of the 
 
three-phase extension will include only the difference for providing such service, regardless of 
which requirement came first. A proportionate share of each three-phase Customer's electric load 
and Construction Allowance where such Customer is served in part from a single-phase extension 
shall be considered in conjunction with other single-phase Applicants served from the extension in 
the calculation of all Construction Payment considerations of the single-phase extension.  
THREE-PHASE CONSIDERATIONS 
Applicant.  
The remaining proportionate share of any such three-phase Customer's electric load and 
Construction Allowance shall be considered in conjunction with the separate three-phase 
Distribution Extension costs and Customer Construction Payments. In 
making the above determination all single-phase Applicants shall be 
considered as being on the same extension regardless of whether such 
Applicants are physically connected to the same phase.

Where Distribution Reinforcement is required for serving an existing Customer s electric 
service from the Company, the Company shall make such Distribution Reinforcement as follows: 
for a Residential or Small Commercial Customer that receives service under a rate schedule which 
is not based on Kilowatt Demand, relating to the Customer's total load requirements, other than a 
High Density Load, Company will make such reinforcements at its expense. 
For all Applicants that receive service under a rate schedule which is based on Kilowatt 
Demand other than a High Density Load, such Distribution Reinforcement shall be an Off-site 
Distribution  Line  Extension  where the  Construction  Costs shall include  the Company s cost to 
reinforce the system necessary to serve Applicant s total load and the Construction Allowance shall 
be based on the difference between the Applicant s current maximum Demand over the previous 
twelve (12) months and the Company s estimate of the Applicant s projected total load. 
Where Distribution Reinforcement is required to serve a High Density Load Customer that 
in whole or in part with another High Density Load Customer causes system capacity to be exceeded 
or the Company s facilities to be overloaded, the Customer shall be required to pay Company the 
necessary costs for the upgrade or reinforcement needed to correct the condition. 
Where  Distribution  Reinforcement  is  required  for  serving  new  Applicants  for  electric 
service  from  Company,  Company  shall  make  such  reinforcement  as  part  of  a  new  On-Site 
Distribution Extension or Off-Site Distribution Line Extension where the Construction Costs shall 
include the Company s cost to reinforce the system as well as new Distribution Extension Facilities 
necessary to serve Applicant s total load and the Construction Allowance and Off-Site Distribution 
Line Extension Credit if applicable shall be applicable to the total Construction Costs.  
For conversion from single-phase to three-phase service and all other classes of service with 
Kilowatt Demand based distribution portion Construction Allowances, any required reinforcement 
shall generally recognize the Construction Cost, Construction Allowance and Off-Site Distribution 
Line Extension Credit if applicable for the Applicant s additional load and Applicant s Construction 
Payment provisions of this extension policy in accordance with individual agreements between 
Applicant  and  Company  based  upon  the  amount,  character  and  permanency  of  the  load.  For 
purposes of this section, all reinforcement for land development shall be considered non-residential 
and the land developer shall be  
responsible for reinforcement costs.

ATO/MTO DUAL FEEDER SERVICE 
DISTRIBUTION EXTENSION POLICY 
 
N 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATO/MTO Dual Feeder Service is supplemental to the electric service provided by the 
 
Company  to  the  Customer  under  the  applicable  rate  schedule  at  either  Primary  or  Secondary 
 
Voltage.  Applicants  may  request  ATO/MTO  Dual  Feeder  Service  from  the  Company.  Upon 
 
 
receiving a request from the Customer, the Company shall assess whether or not such service is 
 
available  through  its  existing  Distribution  Extension  Facilities  or  if  additional  facilities  are 
 
necessary  to  provide  Dual  Feeder  Service  and  whether  the  ATO/MTO  shall  be  Customer  or 
 
Company owned. ATO/MTO Dual Feeder Service shall be provided as set forth hereunder along 
 
with provisions under an agreement between the Company and Customer. 
 
The  ATO/MTO  facilities  shall  be  schematically  detailed  in  the  agreement  and  shall  be 
 
 
 
adequate for the satisfactory operation of Customer's equipment during outages on the preferred 
 
source  of  electric  supply  to  Customer.  The  ATO  facilities  shown  in  the  agreement  provide 
 
automatic load transfer to an alternate source when the initial electric source voltage is lost for any 
 
reason. The MTO facilities shown in the agreement provide manual load transfer by the Customer 
 
to an alternate source when the initial electric source voltage is lost for any reason. 
 
For ATO/MTO facilities owned by the Company, the Company will design, install, own, 
 
operate and maintain the ATO facilities, including all apparatus necessary to deliver and measure 
 
 
electric  energy  and  electric  service  supplied  through  such  ATO/MTO  facilities.  The  separation 
 
between Company-owned equipment and Customer-owned equipment is as schematically detailed 
 
in the agreement. Company agrees to install the ATO/MTO facilities with reasonable promptness, 
 
subject to the availability of labor and material. 
For  the  ATO/MTO  facilities  owned  by  the  Customer,  the  Customer  shall  install,  own, 
operate and maintain the Customer-owned ATO/MTO at Customer s cost. All ATO/MTO facilities 
shall be designed to accommodate the reserve capacity as set forth in the agreement and shall not 
be designed to accommodate future Demand to exceed the reserve capacity. 
For  Company-owned  ATO/MTO  Service  the  Company  shall  install,  own,  operate  and 
maintain the ATO/MTO facilities for the Customer and Customer shall pay Company the cost of 
the ATO/MTO facilities as a non-refundable contribution and shall pay the Company Monthly the 
Incremental Service Charge as set forth in the agreement.

Customer shall grant to Company a non-revocable easement to use premises of Customer 
 
at locations satisfactory to Company and Customer for the purpose of installing, maintaining, and 
 
operating the ATO/MTO facilities and for the related purposes, as set forth in a separate instrument 
 
signed by Customer and Company. 
 
Company  shall  be  responsible  for  all  permitting  or  other  requirements  of  governmental 
 
 
agencies  in  connection  with  Company-owned  ATO/MTO  facilities.  Irrespective  of  ownership, 
 
installation of the ATO facilities shall be coordinated and scheduled by the Customer and Company. 
 
Company will perform maintenance inspections on the ATO/MTO facilities owned by the 
 
Company. All testing and maintenance inspections will be performed during Company's normal 
 
working hours. If Customer requests that special arrangements be made for testing and maintenance 
 
to be performed outside of Company's normal working hours, Customer will be required to pay the 
 
 
difference between regular and overtime pay as set forth on the Schedule of Charges for Rendering 
 
Service section of this Electric Tariff. Company agrees to provide Customer access to such test 
 
results. Any required replacement parts and related labor, as reasonably determined by Company, 
 
will be paid for and furnished by Company if such required replacement parts are necessary due to 
 
normal wear. 
 
 
 
 
 
Customer agrees to pay Company the actual costs incurred by Company for replacement 
parts  and  related  labor  necessitated  by  any  incident  resulting  from  Customer s  negligence  or 
problems on the Customer side of the ATO facilities. Any Company caused incident requiring 
replacement parts and related labor will be paid for and furnished by Company at no additional cost 
to Customer.

UNECONOMIC EXTENSIONS 
DISTRIBUTION EXTENSION POLICY 
The Company shall provide Applicant a Construction Cost estimate as follows: 
 
 
N 
 
 
 
 
 
For Uneconomic Extensions, the Company, under its sole discretion, may investigate the 
 
possibility  of  allowing  Applicant(s)  to  be  served  by  another  utility  as  set  forth  in  the  General 
 
Provisions section of this extension policy. 
 
 
 
 
CONSTRUCTION COST ESTIMATE 
 
 
 
 
Preliminary Plat Estimate - If an Applicant has a preliminary plat for a subdivision, they may acquire 
 
a preliminary drawing and Construction Cost estimate (including documented Applicant inputs and 
 
assumptions)  by  submitting  the  preliminary  plat  and  site  drawing,  anticipated  service  needs, 
 
anticipated timing of construction, and other requirements as requested by the Company. Upon 
 
 
receipt  of  the  required  information  the  Company  will  provide  a  preliminary  drawing  and 
 
Construction Cost estimate to the Applicant within ninety (90) days. The preliminary drawing and 
 
Construction Cost estimate may be subject to change based on new or different information about 
 
the  subdivision  than  was  provided  by  the  Applicant  to  establish  the  preliminary  drawing  and 
 
Construction  Cost  estimate(s).  Exceptions  to  the  ninety  (90)  day  requirement  include  master 
 
planned communities, multi-phase or multi-year developments, or other large projects and mixed 
 
use developments that may require multiple design estimates.  
 
 
  
 
Final Plat Estimate - If an Applicant has a final plat for a subdivision, they may acquire a final 
 
design and Construction Cost estimate (including documented Applicant inputs and assumptions, 
 
and known system reinforcement that may be necessary to serve the subdivision at the time of 
application) by submitting the final plat, site drawing, estimated loads, installation dates and other 
requirements as requested by the Company. Upon receipt of the required information the Company 
will provide a final design and Construction Cost estimate to the Applicant within sixty (60) days. 
The final plat drawing and Construction Cost estimate may be subject to change based on new or 
different information about the subdivision than was provided by the Applicant to establish the final 
drawing and Construction Cost estimate(s). Exceptions to the sixty (60) day requirement include 
master planned communities, multi-phase or multi-year developments, or other large projects and 
mixed use developments 
that may require multiple design estimates.

Company s website. For electric service requests involving large and or 
complex configurations, as determined by the Company, the Company 
shall provide the Applicant the estimated time that it will  
require to provide an estimate of Construction Costs.

The foregoing extension policy applicability is limited by the following conditions:   
 
 
 
The Company's Estimated Construction Costs and Applicant s Construction Payment as 
 
 
calculated for each Off-Site Distribution Line, On-Site Distribution, or Service Lateral Extension 
 
will  become  void  following  a  period  of  one  hundred  and  twenty  (120)  days  from  the  time  an 
 
extension request is received by Company or a period of sixty (60) days following a written estimate 
 
being  provided  by  Company,  whichever  period  ends  later.  If  an  Off-Site  Distribution  Line 
 
Extension Agreement, On-Site Distribution Agreement, or Service Lateral Extension Agreement in 
 
writing is not fully executed within 120 days, the Company, at its sole discretion, may extend said 
 
time period. 
 
 
Construction Cost estimates will not be made for any portion of an extension that cannot be 
 
completed in a normal manner, i.e., following accepted construction practices, within one hundred 
 
and twenty (120) days after execution of the Off-Site Distribution Line Extension Agreement, On-
 
Site Distribution Agreement, or Service Lateral  Agreement, which amount will be determined in 
 
an engineering estimate prepared by the Company at the time the written estimate is prepared, and 
 
such amount will be specified in the written estimate. Any portion of an extension which is not 
 
 
completed  in  a  normal  manner,  i.e.,  following  accepted  construction  practices,  within  the  one 
 
hundred and twenty (120) day period from the execution of the Off-Site Distribution Line Extension 
 
Agreement, On-Site Distribution Agreement, or Service Lateral Extension Agreement will be struck 
 
from the Agreement and Applicant s Construction Payment will be updated accordingly, unless the 
 
delay is caused by the Company, in which event the Construction Payment will become interest 
bearing,  with  the  Company  to  pay  interest  at  the  rate  it  currently  pays  on  residential  security 
deposits, and the construction will not be struck from the Off-Site Distribution Line Extension 
Agreement, On-Site Distribution Agreement, or Service Lateral Extension Agreement under such 
circumstances.

needs, anticipated timing of construction, and other requirements as requested by the Company. 
 
 
Upon receipt of the required information the Company will provide a preliminary drawing and 
 
Construction Cost estimate to the Applicant within ninety (90) days. The preliminary drawing and 
 
Construction Cost estimate may be subject to change based on new or different information about 
 
the  subdivision  than  was  provided  by  the  Applicant  to  establish  the  preliminary  drawing  and 
 
Construction  Cost  estimate(s).  Exceptions  to  the  ninety  (90)  day  requirement  include  master 
 
planned communities, multi-phase or multi-year developments, or other large projects and mixed 
 
use developments that may require multiple design estimates.  
 
 
  
 
Final Plat Estimate - If an Applicant has a final plat for a subdivision, they may acquire a final 
 
design and Construction Cost estimate (including documented Applicant inputs and assumptions, 
 
and known system reinforcement that may be necessary to serve the subdivision at the time of 
application) by submitting the final plat, site drawing, estimated loads, installation dates and other 
requirements  as  requested  by  the  Company.  Upon  receipt  of  the  required  information  the 
Company will provide a final design and Construction Cost estimate to the Applicant within sixty 
(60) days. The final plat drawing and Construction Cost estimate may be subject to change based 
on  new  or  different  information  about  the  subdivision  than  was  provided  by  the  Applicant  to 
establish the final drawing and  Construction Cost estimate(s). Exceptions to the sixty (60)  day 
requirement  include  master  planned  communities,  multi-phase  or  multi-year  developments,  or 
other large projects and mixed use developments 
that may require multiple design estimates.

APPLICABILITY LIMITATION 
DISTRIBUTION EXTENSION POLICY 
 
N 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing extension policy applicability is limited by the following conditions:   
 
 
 
The Company's Estimated Construction Costs and Applicant s Construction Payment as 
 
 
calculated for each Off-Site Distribution Line, On-Site Distribution, or Service Lateral Extension 
 
will  become  void  following  a  period  of  one  hundred  and  twenty  (120)  days  from  the  time  an 
 
extension  request  is  received  by  Company  or  a  period  of  sixty  (60)  days  following  a  written 
 
estimate  being  provided  by  Company,  whichever  period  ends  later.  If  an  Off-Site  Distribution 
 
Line  Extension  Agreement,  On-Site  Distribution  Agreement,  or  Service  Lateral  Extension 
 
Agreement in writing is not fully executed within 120 days, the Company, at its sole discretion, 
 
may extend said time period. 
 
 
Construction Cost estimates will not be made for any portion of an extension that cannot 
 
be  completed  in  a  normal  manner,  i.e.,  following  accepted  construction  practices,  within  one 
 
hundred  and  twenty  (120)  days  after  execution  of  the  Off-Site  Distribution  Line  Extension 
 
Agreement, On-Site Distribution Agreement, or Service Lateral  Agreement, which amount will 
 
be  determined  in  an  engineering  estimate  prepared  by  the  Company  at  the  time  the  written 
 
estimate is prepared, and such amount will be specified in the written estimate. Any portion of an 
 
extension  which  is  not  completed  in  a  normal  manner,  i.e.,  following  accepted  construction 
 
 
practices, within the one hundred and twenty (120) day period from the execution of the Off-Site 
 
Distribution  Line  Extension  Agreement,  On-Site  Distribution  Agreement,  or  Service  Lateral 
 
Extension Agreement will be struck from the Agreement and Applicant s Construction Payment 
 
will  be  updated  accordingly,  unless  the  delay  is  caused  by  the  Company,  in  which  event  the 
Construction Payment will become interest bearing, with the Company to pay interest at the rate it 
currently pays on residential security deposits, and the construction will not be struck from the 
Off-Site  Distribution  Line  Extension  Agreement,  On-Site  Distribution  Agreement,  or  Service 
Lateral Extension Agreement under such circumstances.
